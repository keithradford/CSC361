only having two millionyears? I couldn't make sense of what you were saying." "Oh that," said Ford, "it doesn't matter." "It's just that the world gets demolished to make way for ahyperspace bypass," said Arthur with a shrug, "but that's twomillion years away, and anyway it's just Vogons doing what Vogonsdo." "Vogons?" said Mella. "Yes, you wouldn't know them." "Where'd you get this idea from?" "It really doesn't matter. It's just like a dream from the past,or the future." Arthur smiled and looked away. "Does it worry you that you don't talk any kind of sense?" askedAgda. "Listen, forget it," said Ford, "forget all of it. Nothingmatters. Look, it's a beautiful day, enjoy it. The sun, the greenof the hills, the river down in the valley, the burning trees." "Even if it's only a dream, it's a pretty horrible idea," saidMella, "destroying a world just to make a bypass." "Oh, I've heard of worse," said Ford, "I read of one planet offin the seventh dimension that got used as a ball in a game ofintergalactic bar billiards. Got potted straight into a blackhole. Killed ten billion people." "That's mad," said Mella. "Yes, only scored thirty points too." Agda and Mella exchanged glances. "Look," said Agda, "there's a party after the committee meetingtonight. You can come along if you like." "Yeah, OK," said Ford. "I'd like to," said Arthur. Many hours later Arthur and Mella sat and watched the moon riseover the dull red glow of the trees. "That story about the world being destroyed ..." began Mella. "In two million years, yes." "You say it as if you really think it's true." "Yes, I think it is. I think I was there." She shook her head in puzzlement. "You're very strange," she said. "No, I'm very ordinary," said Arthur, "but some very strangethings have happened to me. You could say I'm more differed fromthan differing." "And that other world your friend talked about, the one that gotpushed into a black hole." "Ah, that I don't know about. It sounds like something from thebook." "What book?" Arthur paused. "The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy," he said at last. "What's that?" "Oh, just something I threw into the river this evening. I don'tthink I'll be wanting it any more," said Arthur Dent.
