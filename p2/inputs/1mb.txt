CHAPTER1


"Um, It's not exactly what I had in mind!"
Ernie Ross looked ruefully at his imitation fur loincloth and
flimsy plastic broadsword. "Um, I sort of thought...."
The girl behind the counter gave Ernie a sour look. "You
wanted to play the `Goombah the Barbarian' Virtual Reality Game,
right?"
"Uh, yeah," Ernie replied.
The girl examined a sheet of paper, cracking her gum loudly.
"In that case, you have to wear the fur loincloth and carry the
plastic broadsword. It says so right here."
Ernie thought about this. "Well, in the ad it said that
playing the game would be just like being Goombah the Barbarian.
There'd be monsters and wizards and everything, just like the
movie!"
"That's correct," replied the girl. "Here at the Virtual
Arcade, we offer simulated reality games of just about any popular
character or story line. Our huge mainframe computers allow us to
synthesize any reality in amazingly high resolution, allowing us to
believably create stories in which YOU can be the main character.
You can step into the role of a commando, a swashbuckler, a space
traveler, just about anything that any popular movie or book has
featured recently. You can act out the role of your favorite
character, doing anything that character could. You can actually BE
your favorite fictional character! You can live out your fantasies,
for only a few dollars a minute!" She seemed to reading from a
prepared statement.
"Well..." Ernie was still unsure. He had heard that these
games were tremendous fun. They had become very popular in the last
few years. You could now find a Virtual Arcade at just about any
major shopping mall (they were franchised). Of course, you had to
pay through the nose to play, but nobody seemed to mind. They were
just so much FUN...
"I still feel silly wearing this fur loincloth and carrying
this big plastic sword," complained Ernie.
"That's what Goombah wears in the movie, isn't it?" the girl
said, looking bored.
"Well..."
The girl looked at the clock. "If you don't want to play
GOOMBAH THE BARBARIAN, I can let you play KILLER LESBIANS FROM
OUTER SPACE instead. I've got a game starting in ten minutes."
"No, no, that's okay," Ernie protested.
A chime sounded. "Your game starts in five minutes!" The girl
warned Ernie, fluffing her hair absently.
Well, I guess I'm stuck with this, Ernie thought. I paid my
$47.95; and there's no refund. I hope this turns out to be worth
the money. Ernie was, after all, just a college student, and didn't
have money to burn.
The chime sounded, again, this time more urgently. "Second
door on your right," the girl said brightly.
This is not starting off well at all, Ernie thought, as he
headed down the hallway. If this doesn't improve real quick, I'm
going to file a complaint, or something.
Ernie entered a small cubicle. A technician sat him down in a
large, comfortable reclining chair, and fitted him with the stereo
goggles and headset that made Virtual Reality come alive. He even
added the latest refinement: tactile sensation electrodes, which he
glued to Ernie's body at strategic locations.
As Ernie settled into the new visions and sensations that
awaited him, he began to feel somewhat better. There before him was
the mysterious landscape that Goombah inhabited in the movies, full
of forbidding crags and castles shaped like skulls. Of course, none
of it was actually there, but the illusion was amazingly realistic.
It was hard to believe it was all just synthesized artificial
reality. Ernie was impressed. Maybe this will be okay after all, he
thought. He unsheathed his huge plastic broadsword, preparing to be
attacked by dragons, wizards, or any of the other fearsome
mythological characters that Goombah customarily battled.
Suddenly, Ernie heard a loud, high-pitched bark. He looked
down and saw a little white dog with a black spot over one eye. The
dos looked up at him expectantly.Ernie was not prepared for
something like this. I'm supposed to be Goombah the Barbarian, he
thought. Goombah does not have any silly little dog!
The dog suddenly jumped up into Ernie's arms. He caught it
automatically. It peered up into his face, as though expecting him
to do something.
"This has got to be a mistake", said Ernie to himself
exasperatedly. "This dog must be from somebody else's game. What am
I gonna do with him?" 
Before he could think about the problem any further, abright
light in the sky attracted Ernie's attention. Here it comes, he
thought, gripping his broadsword tightly. What will it be, a demon,
a flying dragon? Ernie strained his eyes. It's...a flying saucer?
Sure enough, it was a flying saucer, looking as though it had come
straight from an old 1950's science-fiction movie. Ernie was taken
aback. There weren't supposed to be any flying saucers in Goombah
the Barbarian!
The flying saucer quickly landed a few yards in front of
Ernie, and two space creatures emerged. They seemed to be some kind
of humanoid reptiles. They reminded Ernie of giant iguanas. The dog
under Ernie's arm wriggled uncomfortably.
Ernie frowned. Space creatures? he thought. What am I supposed
to do with space creatures? This isn't what I was expecting at all!
Ernie frowned. What kind of game is this, anyway?! The creatures
began approaching Ernie.
Maybe I'm supposed to say something, he considered. Suddenly,
an idea occurred to him. He drew himself up to his full height.
"Klaatu barada nikto!" he announced.
One of the space creatures pulled out a ray gun and pointed it
at him. Hmm, thought Ernie. Maybe that wasn't quite the right thing
to say. It occurred to Ernie that a strategic retreat might be a
good idea. He looked around quickly. Unfortunately, the landscape
of swirling mists and forbidding hills didn't seem to contain
anyplace to retreat to.
Ernie turned back to the creatures. "Look, uh, what I said
about Klaatu, I didn't really mean..." The creature fired. Ernie
felt himself suddenly stiffen into immobility.
"It's stunned, sir," Ernie heard one creature say to the
other.
"Good, load it onto the ship." The two creatures lifted Ernie,
who had become stiff as a board, and began carrying him, dog and
all, toward the ship.
In spite of himself, Ernie was impressed. These special
effects are fantastic, he thought. I wonder how they do that
Stunner business?
Suddenly, a costumed comic-book character appeared, complete
with flowing cape and a big, red `M' on his chest. He blocked the
aliens' path. "Unhand that barbarian!" the comic-book character
boomed.
The space creature looked at each other in confusion. "Unhand?
What does that mean? Are we supposed to cut off his hands?"
The comic-book character looked exasperated. "Look, just put
him down, okay?" he said, in a much more conversational tone.
"Put him down? Put him down?" One space creature looked at the
other. "What do we do now, sir?"
"Oh, I don't know", the other creature replied. "Just
disintegrate him, I guess." They drew their weapons.
The comic-book character looked confused. "Um..uh.." The
creatures advanced menacingly.
Suddenly, the comic-book character shouted what seemed to
Ernie to be a very odd thing. "JMP 08F1!"
Instantly, the entire scene vanished. Ernie, still stiff and
board-like, found himself unsupported, and dropped three feet to
land with a thud on a carpeted floor. "Hi guy!" Ernie heard someone
say. "Howya doin'?"
Ernie attempted to moan, but discovered that he was still
quite securely frozen. "Here, let me help you up," he heard the
same voice say. The room swung into view as he felt himself lifted
up and placed on his feet like a statue. He seemed to be in
someone's living room.
The owner of the voice came into view. It was the comic-book
character, who in the cold light of day appeared to be a pleasant,
although rather vacuous-looking fellow of indeterminate age. "Allow
me to introduce myself," he said cheerfully. "I'm Captain Memory!"
He extended a hand. Ernie instinctively attempted to shake the
man's hand, but discovered he was still quite frozen. It occurred
to him that he was still carrying the silly little dog, which was
also frozen.
The man dropped his outstretched hand embarrassedly. "Hey, I
forgot," he said cheerfully. "You're still paralyzed! Hey, no
sweat! It'll wear off in a few minutes!" The man seated himself on
a nearby sofa and began perusing a small book he had produced from
somewhere. Ernie, of course, continued to stand where he was,
immobilized.
This is a really weird game, Ernie thought. The special
effects are fantastic, but the story line is bizarre. Like, what am
I supposed to do now?
After about fifteen minutes, Ernie's little finger began to
twitch. The twitching slowly spread across his hand. Finally, with
great effort, Ernie was able to take a step towards the comic-book
character, who was still seated on the sofa, reading his book.
The comic-book character looked up. "Ah, it's wearing off!"
he said. "Are you feeling okay?' 
"Ungph", said Ernie, discovering that the power of speech was
slowly returning to him.
Captain Memory took that to mean "yes". "Good, good," he
replied in a cheerful tone. 
"Wharf gumg om?" Ernie got out with difficulty.
"You're probably wondering what's going on."
"Yarf!"
Ernie felt something sharp digging into his side. It was the
little dog, trying to get away. Unfortunately, that arm had not
unfrozen yet. 
Ernie's ability to speak seemed to have returned. "All right,
so what IS going on?"
"I had to rescue you from those creatures,"Captain Memory
explained. "They were taking you to be a Cyberslave in the mining
pits."
Ernie frowned. "What's a Cyberslave?"
Captain Memory shook his head sadly. "They were going to force
you to operate mining robots, like so many other poor fools before
you. Like you, they thought they were going to play a game. The
next thing they knew, they were forced into a life of virtual hard
labor, operating mining robots 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, until
finally their bodies shrivelled up and their brains burned out." He
sighed. "I was too late for most of them, but at least I could save
the two of you!"
Ernie shivered. Some of this was beginning to seem alittle
too real. "Man, this is a really strange game!" he said. "I'm not
complaining, mind you! I mean, the special effects alone make it
worth the money!" He looked around. He seemed to be in a huge
living room, all decorated in 1950's style. It all seemed very
solid and believable. Ernie couldn't help being impressed. "I mean,
this is, like, SO realistic! It's just that I'm having a real hard
time following the story! Like, what is supposed to be happening in
this game, anyway?"
Captain Memory sighed. "Look, I'm trying to explain this to
you. It's NOT a game, okay? That game business was just a ruse. It
was a trap to get you to come in and hook yourself up to their
Virtual Reality system. Once you're in, you can't get out! They
turn you into a Cyberslave, and make you work until your brain
burns up!"
"Oh, right," Ernie caught himself. "I get it. You're not
supposed to admit it's a game. You're supposed to pretend it's
real. Okay, I'll play along. So, what now?"
Captain Memory shook his head sadly. "I can see this isn't
going to be easy." He thought a moment. "Okay, if this is a game,
you should be able to quit any time you like, right?"
"Uh, yeah." This was beginning to make Ernie uneasy.
"So, how do you quit?" the Captain demanded. "Where's the ESC
button, or BREAK or whatever? HOW do you get out?"
Ernie suddenly realized that he hadn't been given any
information on what to do when he wanted to quit playing. "Uh,
well, I can quit anytime I want," he said defensively.
"Okay; try!" Captain Memory demanded.
Ernie shuffled uncomfortably. "Well, maybe I'm not ready to
quit yet!"
"Try it, just to see what happens!" the Captain urged.
"Well", Ernie considered. "It looks like I got into the wrong
game here. I wanted to play GOOMBAH THE BARBARIAN. I mean, no
offense, this is a cool game and everything, but I really wanted to
play GOOMBAH!"
Captain Memory looked upset. "This really isn't a game!"
Ernie sighed. "I'll tell you what. I'll just give up on this
for today, and I'll try again a week from Thursday, okay? So, I'll
just be heading home now, okay?"
"Great!" said the Captain enthusiastically. "Just quit right
now, okay?"
"Well, okay," Ernie agreed halfheartedly. He tried to think of
what to do. "Hello!" he called up into the air. "Is anybody there?
I'd like to go now!" Nothing happened. 
Ernie's heart began to pound. "Hey, c'mon! Isn't anybody
listening to me? I said `I wanna GO!'" No response.
This was beginning to be more than Ernie felt he could deal
with."Look, I'm not asking for my money back, or anything. I'll,
you know, try again some other time. I just want to go home, okay?"
No answer.
Now Ernie really DID want to go! He began to panic. "Hey,
isn't anybody out there!? WAKE UP!! I don't wanna play anymore! I
wanna go home!" He wailed, "I WANT MY MOMMY!!" Nothing!
"All right, all right, calm down!" Captain Memory tried to
soothe Ernie. "We'll get you out of here! It's just going to
take...a little time!"
Ernie's left arm unfroze convulsively, dumping the little dog
on the floor. It growled unpleasantly. "Why can't you get me out of
here NOW?" he demanded petulantly.
The Captain shrugged. "Hey, I don't run this show! I was lucky
I could even get you away from those creatures! Getting out is
another story altogether!"
"Oh, this is awful!" Ernie wailed. He still wasn't entirely
sure whether this was a game or not, but whatever it was, he didn't
like it anymore!
"Maybe you'd better sit down." Captain Memory moved over to
one side of the sofa. Ernie decided that sitting down was probably
a good idea, and did so. This was beginning to get altogether too
real. "Anyway, it could be worse!"
"How?" Ernie moaned.
"You could be like that poor guy over there," the Captain
said, gesturing towards the dog.
"I don't need your sympathy," the dog snapped.
Ernie started. "A talking dog! This is unbelievable! What
next?"
"Yeah, yeah", the dog snarled. "Believe me, you don't look so
hot in that ridiculous fur loincloth either! Goombah the Barbarian!
I'm sure!"The dog pulled a cigar out of some invisible pocket and
began to smoke it, holding it in his front paw in a very un-canine
manner.
Ernie was suddenly very conscious of his loincloth. He looked
at the dog. "What..what...?"
"See what I mean?" the Captain gestured towards the dog. "In
Virtual Reality, you can be anybody, or anything! You're lucky you
came through as yourself! You could have wound up like him, as a
dog!"
The dog made a wry expression. "Yeah, right. Or like YOU!" He
looked the Captain up and down. "A super hero?" he said
sarcastically.
Captain Memory seemed nonplussed. "Well...what's wrong with
that?"
"I'm sure!" the replied. "Okay, what super powers have you
got?"
The Captain seemed defensive. "Well, I do have some powers!"
"Like what?"
"Well..." the Captain thought a moment. "Like, I program in
Assembler, and he doesn't!"
"Wait a minute!" Ernie was confused. "WHO doesn't?"
"Why, the man behind all this, of course," the Captain
explained. "The evil genius, Waldo Stadium!"
"Oh, I get it!" Ernie brightened. "This really is a game,
right?"
Captain Memory sighed exasperatedly. "Look, for the last time,
this is NOT a game. The evil genius, Waldo Stadium, has embarked on
a plan to take over the entire world's computing power. He's been
breaking into people's systems one at a time, taking control of
them, and linking them to his other systems to create a vast
network that grows more powerful all the time. When he takes over
a system, he establishes complete control over anything and anybody
that happens to be in it at the time. That's how you fell into his
clutches. He's taken over the Virtual Arcades; anyone who was
playing a Virtual Reality games there is now his Cyberslave!"
"Oh, man!" Ernie sank his head into his hands. This was just
too much to handle! Suddenly, a thought occurred to him. "So, how
did we get here, anyway?" He gestured to the room around them.
Captain Memory pulled himself up to his full height. "I
brought you here!" he said proudly. He turned to the dog. "See, I
told you I had powers!"
"Great," said the dog sarcastically. "So where are we,
anyway?"
"We're in Virtual Reality," the Captain explained. "You know,
Cyberspace."
"Wait a minute," Ernie was finding this all hard to follow.
"If we're still in the computer, doesn't that mean that this guy
Waldo Supermarket has control over us?"
"Stadium", Captain Memory corrected.
"Whatever," Ernie said exasperatedly. "What about my question?
Who's in control here?"
"Ah, that the beauty of it," explained the Captain, warming to
his subject. "He's been taking over systems so fast that he can't
keep track of them. He doesn't even know what he's got! Remember,
when he takes over a system, he gets EVERYTHING that was in it.
He's got games, spreadsheets, database files, and hundreds of
different Virtual Realities, all mixed together in no order! That's
what gives us our window of opportunity. We can hide out in areas
he doesn't even know he's got, until we figure out how to bring
this diabolical scheme to a halt!"
Ernie thought about this. "Okay, we're in Cyberspace."
"Right."
"But where in Cyberspace?"
The Captain slumped. "Well....I don't exactly know."
The dog snickered. "Some super hero!"
"Well, well, I was under a lot of pressure!" The Captain said
defensively. "Those creatures would have had you in another second!
So, I just picked a location at random and JUMPed to it!"
"You JUMPed to it?" Ernie was confused. "How do you do that?"
"That's the beauty of Assembler," the Captain answered
enthusiastically. "You can do stuff like that! Now, with a high-
level language, you'd never be able to do stuff like that. You can
only do what the language says you can do. In Assembler, you can do
ANYTHING." Captain Memory chuckled. "That's Waldo's weak point. He
refuses to learn Assembler. He insists you can do all this stuff in
C, or whatever language he using now. Well, we'll show..."
Suddenly, the dog broke in. "At RANDOM!?" he barked. "You
JUMPed at RANDOM?!!!"
"Well..." the Captain was taken aback.
"You mean," the dog continued. "We could have wound up in the
middle of a SPREADSHEET!!?"
Ernie tried to imagine life in a spreadsheet. It didn't sound
too appealing.
"It was a chance I had to take," Captain Memory explained
defensively.
"Great," the dog snarled. "You take chances with our lives!"
"Okay, okay," the Captain said placatingly. "I've got a better
location." He rummaged furiously through the pockets in his
costume. "I wrote it down; it's here somewhere." he continued
searching. "Um, no, um AHA!" He brandished a small slip of paper in
the air. "Here it is!" He read the paper aloud. "It's: INSPECTED BY
NO. 42!"
"Some super hero!" the dog repeated.
The Captain frowned. "Well, maybe that's not the right one!"
He continued to rummage through his pockets. "I'm sure I had it
here somewhere!"
Ernie looked askance at the comic-book character. "You don't
REMEMBER it?"
Captain Memory fidgeted uncomfortably. "Hey, it's not easy to
remember a long string of numbers in Hex, you know! I'm doing the
best I can!"
Ernie moaned quietly. This was all giving him a terrible
headache. Suddenly a thought occurred to him. "Hey, this is all
really just a game, right?
Captain Memory looked annoyed. "No, it is not a game. It never
was a game. Will you PLEASE stop saying that!"
Ernie moaned quietly. Captain Memory glanced at his wrist.
"We'd better hurry. We're running out of time."
Ernie looked up. "You don't have a watch," he said
suspiciously. 
Captain Memory continued to look at his bare wrist. "Well,
no," he said, a bit crestfallen. "I always wanted one, though."
Ernie looked around. "Can't we just stay here? It's nice
here." They seemed to be in a very large living room of a well-kept
home. It appeared to be furnished in Fabulous Fifties style, except
for a few odd objects that Ernie couldn't identify.
"We can't stay in one place to long," replied Captain Memory.
"Waldo Stadium is sorting his data as fast as he can. If we stay in
one place too long, sooner or later he'll zero in on us. Anyway,"
Captain Memory looked around. "This place is beginning to look kind
of familiar to me. If I'm right, this isn't a safe place to be!"
"Okay, then where are we?" the dog demanded.
"I think we've landed in a game called `ATTACK OF THE GIANT
EGGPLANT.' If I'm right, this place is going to be nuked in" he
glanced at his bare wrist again, "oh, forty-five minutes or so."
Ernie began to be aware of a queasy feeling in the pit of his
stomach. This is making me anxious, he thought. I'm not going to do
things like this anymore. That's it, no more Virtual Reality for
me.
"Maybe you'd like to watch some TV," Captain Memory suggested
cheerfully. "Maybe that would make you feel better."
"I thought we were in a hurry," Ernie answered.
"We can watch for a couple minutes," the Captain replied.
I guess that makes as much sense as anything else, Ernie
thought, and followed the Captain towards the other end of the
room, where he noticed a television with a ten-foot-wide screen
playing with the sound turned off.
As they approached the television Ernie noticed a large, high-
backed '50's-style sofa positioned close in front of the TV. As
they came around the side of the sofa Ernie was startled to see two
people sitting there, staring intently at the television screen.
"Hey!" Ernie uttered involuntarily.
The two people seemed oblivious to Ernie's presence. "Um,
hello?" Ernie said tentatively. "Excuse me?" The people did not
respond.
Captain Memory sighed. "It's too late for them, I'm afraid."
Ernie moaned. "I wished you'd stop saying depressing things.
It makes my stomach hurt."
"Oh, sorry." Captain Memory seemed concerned. "Um, how about
`It's too late for them, I'm pleased to say?'"
"That's not much better."
Captain Memory shrugged. "Hey, I tried." He fell silent.
Ernie looked at the people. They seemed frozen into position,
staring at the television. They seemed emaciated; their muscles
seemed to have withered in the positions they were in. "Okay, so
what's wrong with them?"
Captain Memory shook his head. "They've been in Cyberspace too
long," he said sadly. "There's a limit to how much of this you can
take, you know. Your brain burns out. I don't think these two have
much longer. All they can do is sit here in front of the TV."
Captain Memory sighed. "Terrible, just terrible. Look at them; they
can't even change channels anymore."
Ernie shuddered. This is gruesome, he thought. I think it's
bad for me to look at gruesome things.
"Oh well," Captain Memory brightened. "Can't be helped." The
Captain unceremoniously pushed the stricken couple off the sofa.
They fell stiffly to the floor, motionless except for their eyes,
which rotated to stay fixed on the television screen. Captain
Memory seated himself as comfortably as possible on the sofa. "So,
what do you want to watch?"
They heard a voice behind them. "Crap!" The dog was looking
ruefully at his half-burned cigar and cursing quietly.
"What's the matter?" Captain Memory inquired cheerfully.
"I'm almost out of cigars," the dog groused. "Here I am stuck
in this stupid pointless computer game, and I can't even get a
decent cigar."
"Well, maybe we can get you some more, uh, what was your name
again?" The Captain inquired.
"Sterno." The dog intoned pompously.
"Sterno?" said Ernie dubiously. "What kind of a name is that?
Sterno is those little cans of heating stuff."
"I'll have you know that I am Lord High Keeper of the Sacred
Flame. Why, in better days...."
"Oh, I remember now!" the Captain broke in brightly. "That's
a game called `DOG STAR'! You must have been playing it when Waldo
took over your system! That's why you're trapped in the body of a
dog!"
Sterno was taken aback. "Uh, well, yeah, I was..."
"Lord High Keeper of the Sacred Flame, huh?" the Captain
continued. "You were doing pretty good!"
Sterno brightened. "Well, yes, as a matter of fact..."
"Wanna watch `Stump the Stars'?" Captain Memory said to Ernie,
cutting off Sterno's tales of past glory.
"What's that about?" inquired Ernie.
"It's this game show where famous Hollywood celebrities have
to answer these questions, and if they get them wrong, they get
their arms and legs chopped off. Stumps, get it?" Captain Memory
laughed.
Ernie frowned. "I don't like these new game shows." He glanced
at the television. The program seemed to be a game show. The MC was
an unpleasant looking man wearing a black military uniform with
skulls on the collar. He wore a monocle in his left eye, and
carried a riding crop, which he periodically cracked against his
jackboots.
"Oh, it's one of those sadistic Nazi game show hosts," said
Ernie. "Isn't there anything else on?"
Captain Memory was paging through a copy of TV Guide. "Doesn't
look like there's anything on except game shows. How about `Vomit
for Dollars'?"
Ernie grimaced.
"Here's a movie," the Captain continued. "How about `The
Humpback of Notre Dame', starring Ronald Reagan? You know, the one
about the whale that plays football?"
Ernie sighed. "What's this we're watching now?"
"I don't know." Captain Memory reached for a dial. "Let's turn
up the volume and find out."
The off-camera announcer's voice came blasting out off the
set, painfully loud. "... time for Wheel of Torture! The show which
every week asks the question: How much can you take?"
The sound of applause welled up from the audience.
"And here's our host," the announcer continued. "The Gestapo's
greatest, that famous fiend, Sturmbannfuhrer Dr. Heinz von
Liederkranz!"
Once again the sound of applause welled up. The sound seemed
to be growing impossibly loud. In fact, it seemed to be coming from
all around them.

The game show host smiled and bowed to the audience. "Tank
you, tank you!"
"Now, let's drag in today's first victim!" The announcer
continued. "FromPalo Alto, California, let's have a big
round of applause for: CAPTAIN MEMORY!"
The huge waves of applause filled Ernie's head, blocking out
everything else. He clenched his eyes tightly, trying to regain his
composure. He opened them again, and staggered back in shock. They
were no longer in the suburban living room. They were actually
standing on the stage that they had been watching only seconds
before. They had actually been sucked INTO the game show!
Captain Memory seemed confused. "Hey, uh, wait a minute. I
didn't..."
The announcer continued. "And here's contestant number two!
From the Landthat Time Forgets, let's have a big hand for:
Goombah the Barbarian!"
Ernie realized that they meant him. A Nazi SS trooper grabbed
him, and shoved him roughly forward."Hey, lemme go...ow. Look.
I'm not supposed..."
"Say, I just LOVE your loincloth!", the announcer quipped.
Ernie could hear the audience laughing. He began to feel
terribly self-conscious.
"And what a CUTE little dog!" the announcer went on.
Sterno didn't seem to be particularly bothered by the state of
affairs. "Say, you got a cigar?"
"Why SURE!" The announcer handed him one. The audience
chuckled.
The announcer continued. "Well, all RIGHT then! Dr. von
Liederkranz, what are we going to start out with today?"
The Nazi smiled theatrically. "Vell, Biff, I tought I'd shtart
out vit a liddle infention of mein own: de Hot Vhirling Corshcrew!"
He pulled out a fiendish-looking device, made of glowing, whirling
metal parts. Without warning, he jabbed Captain Memory with it. The
Captain let out a blood-curdling shriek.
The audience applauded wildly.
"VERY good!" The announcer exclaimed jovially. "Now, let's see
how that rated on our applause meter. A 57! Well, that's..."
"Forget this!" shouted Captain Memory. "JMP 08F1!"
Suddenly, Ernie found himself back on the porcelain sofa. The
TV was now off. Ernie was trembling. "Wha...what happened?"
Captain Memory was rubbing his side ruefully. "Oh, I JUMPed us
back here. I really didn't like that Hot Whirling Corkscrew!"
"Good cigar, though." Sterno added, puffing away. The cigar
seemed to have improved his disposition somewhat.
"I...I don't understand," Ernie whined.
"You know how in a lot of computer games there's these little
doors or windows or something, and when you step through them
you're on a whole different level?" Captain Memory asked.
"Yeah?" Ernie replied tentatively.
"Well," the Captain gestured towards the TV. "That's one of
them!"
Ernie noticed an odd smell. He glanced towards the floor. The
two shrivelled people were...vibrating. Wisps of smoke seemed to be
coming out of their ears.
"Oh, I forgot," said the Captain. "You're never supposed to
turn the TV off on these people. Something bad happens... I forget
exactly what, but it's real bad."
Ernie continued to watch the couple in horror. The smoke was
coming more heavily new. Their foreheads seemed to be bulging.
"What...what are we gonna do?" Ernie choked out.
Captain Memory regarded his bare wrist carefully. "Some day
I'm gonna get a watch," he said thoughtfully.
"I really think we ought to do something," said Ernie
anxiously. Smoke was coming out of their noses now. Light seemed to
be appearing behind their eyes.
"A silver watch might be nice. Do you think silver would look
good with this outfit?" Captain Memory wondered.
"I really, REALLY think we ought to do something!" said Ernie
urgently. The TV addicts bodies were beginning to swell rapidly.
Ernie inched away from them.
"Oh well," said Captain Memory unhurriedly. "I guess it's
time to go. Uh, let's see." He thought a moment. "Let's try: PUSH
FF0C." With that, they were gone.
Ernie blinked and staggered. The scene had changed completely. 
Now he saw an elaborate 18th century drawing room around him. The
walls were decorated with filigreed mirrors and candelabras.
Delicate furniture surrounded them. It all looked very expensive. 
Captain Memory looked about, obviously pleased with
himself. "Hey, it worked!"
Ernie's head swam. He felt confused and disoriented. These
abrupt changes of scene were making him sick. He sagged into a
chair. "I don't feel very good," he complained.
Sterno puffed his cigar. "This is almost decent," he mused.
"You don't suppose there's a snifter of brandy about, do you?" The
sound of a harpsichord drifted in from somewhere. "Ah, Telemann,"
Sterno commented. "Very tasteful."
Captain Memory turned to Ernie. "Gee, I'm sorry you're not
feeling well," he commiserated. "Would it make you feel better to
watch some TV?"
Ernie sat bolt upright. "NO!"
The Captain had brought along his copy of TV Guide. "You're
missing the `Ozzie and Hitler Show'."
"I don't care."
"This is a good episode: `Ozzie forgets that the boss is
coming for dinner, so Hitler has to invade Poland on a moment's
notice.'" Captain Memory chuckled.
"I don't like these TV programs," grumbled Ernie.
"Well, you know," said Captain Memory conversationally. "If
you're going to travel to other Realities, you're not always going
to be able to get your favorite TV shows."
"I want to go home," Ernie sulked. Suddenly a thought occurred
to him. He brightened. "Hey, this is really just a game, right?"
Sterno glared at him. "This `game' business is getting really
old. Knock it off, okay?"
Ernie had begun methodically feeling the furniture. He
reasoned that if it were a Virtual Reality illusion, he would be
able to see it, but since it had no substance, he wouldn't be able
to feel it. If my hand goes right through this stuff, he figured,
I'll know it's just an illusion. Unfortunately, everything was
proving to be distressingly solid.
"You know, you look really stupid in that fur loincloth,"
Sterno commented. "And what in the world are you going to do with
that ridiculous plastic broadsword?"
"Well, I hadda put a deposit on it," said Ernie defensively.
"If I don't bring it back I lose 40 bucks." 
Sterno shook his head. He turned to Captain Memory. "Do we
really have to drag this kid around with us?"
Captain Memory shook his head sadly. "I'm afraid so."
"Why?" Sterno demanded.
"Well, you know", the Captain said off-handedly. "We can't
just leave him to be a Cyberslave. It wouldn't be, you know, nice."
A thought occurred to Ernie. "So, what are we supposed to do
about all of this, anyway?"
"Hmm?" Captain Memory, still perusing the TV Guide, was not
paying very much attention.
"Like, are we just going to keep bopping around Cyberspace or
what? I mean, do you have a Plan, or something?"
Captain Memory pulled himself up. "Of course I have a Plan!"
He turned to Sterno. "See? I have Powers, and I have a Plan!"
"Okay, okay," Sterno agreed wearily. "You're a fine super
hero! So, what's the plan?"
"We have to find a way to terminate this reality within the
confines of it's own logic," the Captain explained.
"Huh?" Ernie didn't follow this.
"We have to end the game," the Captain rephrased. "We have to
carry it through to it's logical conclusion, so that it terminates,
and shuts down."
Ernie frowned. "What's the point of this game, anyway?"
"That's a problem," the Captain admitted. "This isn't a game.
It's dozens, maybe hundreds of games, all stuck together in no
order. The "point" of what we're in now could be the point of any
of the games, or all of them, or none of them. There's no way to
tell. Luckily, we don't have to win the game, we just have to end
it. Any ending that's logically consistent will do."
Sterno frowned. "Why do you have to end it within it's own
logic system? Couldn't you just crash it?"
Captain Memory sighed. "I could crash the system, but it
wouldn't be a good idea!"
"Why not?" Sterno demanded. "Why can't you just insert some
totally impossible instruction and crash out the whole system? Then
this whole thing would be over and we could get out of here!"
"That's true," the Captain admitted. "but you'd get some bad,
um, side effects."
"Like what?" Sterno wanted to know.
"You see,"Captain Memory explained. "After you've been in
Cyberspace for a while, you brain gets synchronized with it, and
your system becomes adapted to it. If it suddenly crashes, it
causes a tremendous shock to your system."
"What, you mean we're going through all this just to avoid an
upset stomach or something?" Sterno asked sarcastically. "After
all, how bad could it be?"
"Well, um," the Captain looked very uncomfortable. "It's not
just an upset stomach...."
"Okay," Sterno demanded. "Then what DOES it cause?"
"Um, generally, cardiac arrest," the Captain answered
reluctantly.
Sterno was shocked. "You mean, if you crash the system it'll
KILL us?"
"Afraid so," the Captain nodded sadly. "Along with anybody
else who's hooked into the system at the time."
Ernie began to worry. "What about ending the game, then? Won't
that kill us, too? Does that mean we're trapped here forever!?" He
began to panic.
"No, no, calm down," said the Captain reassuringly. "if we end
the game within the confines of it's own logic, it'll shut down in
an orderly manner, giving your systems time to readjust before
you're returned to reality.It won't be a shock to your systems, and
your hearts won't stop. It's only if it suddenly, abruptly, stops,
like when the system crashes, that..."
"Okay, okay, we get the picture," Sterno broke it. "Don't
crash the system!"
"Okay." Captain Memory returned to the TV Guide.
Ernie sighed. It was bad enough being trapped in a computer
game. Now his life was in danger as well. And his only hope seems
to be this costumed clown who thinks he's a super hero. Wasn't this
ever going to stop getting worse?
Suddenly, Captain Memory started. "Oh NO," he wailed. "Not
THAT!"
"What happened? What happened?!" cried Ernie, panic-stricken.
What could possibly have happened that was worse than the
predicament they were already in?
Captain Memory was still holding the TV Guide. "We missed
Gilligan's Island!"
Ernie cradled his head in his hands. "I can't stand it. I just
can't stand it."





Chapter 2


Ernie was beginning to feel a little bit better. After all,
nothing really weird had happened for about, oh, twenty minutes or
so. Things were, relatively speaking, pretty quiet.
Ernie examined his surroundings. "What is this place?"
"It's a spaceship," said Captain Memory conversationally.
Ernie was skeptical. "It doesn't LOOK like a spaceship."
Sterno sniffed. "They don't have to always be those ghastly
chrome-and-glass space things. Utterly tasteless. This place,"
Sterno looked about approvingly. "Is actually not bad."
Ernie was unconvinced. "It's not moving."
"Sure it is," the Captain returned. "You just can't feel it.
Wanna look out?" Captain Memory stood up, and walked over to what
appeared to be a small harpsichord. He regarded the keys. "Let's
see. Um, C Major?" He hit the appropriate keys. With a deep
rumbling sound, the ceiling slid back, revealing a view of deep
space. "Ah!" Captain Memory was pleased. He returned to the sofa.
Ernie regarded the view with amazement. Stars and galaxies
burned brightly against the blackness of space. They seemed to be
an incredible distance from Earth. Ernie turned to Captain Memory.
"Where ARE we?"
The Captain shrugged. "Space."
"But where in space?" Ernie wanted to know. "Are we far from
Earth?"
Captain Memory concentrated. "Let's see, um, `Long, long, ago
in a galaxy far, far..." Ernie frowned. The Captain stopped. "Wait,
that's not right." He furrowed his brow. "Well, I can't exactly
recall where we are, but it doesn't really matter." Captain Memory
was absorbed in looking at the vista of deep space. "After all,
when you wish upon a star, it makes no difference where you are."
Ernie frowned. "Something about that bugs me."
"It doesn't sound quite cricket," agreed Sterno.
"Well, by jiminy," exclaimed the Captain. "We'll just have to
move on to something else. Wanna watch some TV?"
"I'd rather not," said Ernie.
"Aww." Captain Memory was disappointed.
Ernie looked around. "Are we safe here?"
"For the moment," the Captain shrugged. "As I said, we can't
stay anywhere too long. Waldo will zero in on us if we do."
"Then what?" Ernie wanted to know.
"I dunno," the Captain mused. "I suppose he'll come after us."
Ernie frowned. "You mean he'll come in himself, like
personally?"
Captain Memory thought about that. "Well, I don't suppose
he'll come in AS himself. After all, you can be anyone, or
anyTHING, in Cyperspace. He'll come in the form of someone else,
some famous person, or someone he'd like to be..."
"Like you and your super-hero outfit," Sterno broke in.
"Well...yeah," the Captain admitted.
Ernie gave than some thought. "So, what form would an evil
genius want to take?"
Captain Memory shrugged. "I dunno. A Nazi, maybe..." He
returned to the TV Guide.
"This is much like my own Virtual Reality," mused Sterno. He
seemed to have found a snifter of brandy somewhere, which he
swirled pensively in his left paw. "I had a drawing room like this.
I wrote poetry there. Immortal odes to the glory of the canine
race."
"Really." Captain Memory was not really paying attention.
"In fact, I happen to have some with me. Perhaps you'd like to
see it?"
"Mmm." Captain Memory was gazing at the view. Sterno took his
answer to be a `yes', and handed him a piece of paper with some
verses on it. 
Captain Memory barely glanced at it. "Looks like doggerel to
me," he said uncaringly.
Sterno's mood turned black. "I suppose you think that's
funny," he snarled. "I open my heart to you, and you mock me. Well,
we'll see who has the last laugh! I know when I'm right! I'm right,
and you're wrong, and that's all there is to it."
Ernie thought a moment. "Sounds to me like you're being a bit
dogmatic to me."
"You fool!" Sterno barked. "You don't even have the vaguest
idea what's going on here! You're a fine one to talk!"
Captain Memory abruptly changed the subject. "Wanna watch some
TV?" 
Ernie really didn't want to watch any TV, but he was feeling
very uncomfortable with the current drift of the conversation.
Maybe watching TV would be a good way to change the subject.
"Uh, this isn't gonna be like last time, is it? We're not
going to get sucked into the TV show again, are we?"
"Naw," the Captain assured him. "That was a fluke. One-in-a-
million chance. It'll never happen again."
"Well, okay then," Ernie agreed reluctantly.
Captain Memory returned to the harpsichord. "Um, F-sharp?" He
hit the appropriate keys. The ceiling view-screen suddenly changed
from a view of space to a television picture. They seemed to have
tuned in to a commercial.
The announcer was an dour looking man wearing a brown military
uniform and jackboots. He seemed to be making a strenuous effort to
be cheerful.
"Hi, I'm Martin Bohrmann," the announcer held up two record
albums. "And if you remember me, you remember HITLER'S GREATEST
HITS!"
"I don't remember that," said Ernie to no-one in particular.
"Now, together at last on these two long-playing record
albums, 50 all-time golden hits from the Third Reich! You get the
Gestapo Glee Club with HEIL HITLER, DEAR!" Military-sounding music
started up in the background.
"Do we have to watch this?" Ernie complained.
"...you can't buy these records in any store, but if you call
this number, a secret messenger will knock on your door in the
middle of the night and..."
"Oh, okay, I'll change it." Captain Memory struck a key on the
harpsichord. The screen changed to black-and-white. Characters in
1950's clothing appeared.
"It's an old movie," Ernie commented. He felt better. An old
movie; that would be safe, right? Nothing bad could happen out of
an old movie, right?
A man in a suit with a cloth over his head appeared on the
screen. A pretty young woman came up to him, and suddenly yanked
the cloth away. Under the cloth, the man had the tremendously
enlarged head of a fly, complete with huge, multifaceted eyes,
antennae, and a long black snout. The young woman began to scream.
"Hey, I remember this!" said Ernie brightly. It's THE FLY -
the original version, too. You know, that movie about the scientist
who goes into a matter transmitter, except a fly gets in it, and he
winds up with the head of a fly? Hey, this is a great movie!" Ernie
settled back to watch, pleased that he could finally watch
something he understood.
The movie cut to a commercial. "Hi, I'm Martin Bohrmann, and
if you remember me..."
Ernie moaned. I wish they wouldn't keep running the same
commercial, he thought.
The commercial ended. "And now, back to THE DATING GAME!"
"THE DATING GAME!" Ernie sat bolt upright. "I don't wanna
watch the Dating Game! What happened to my movie?!"
Captain Memory looked up. "Oh, a game show!" he said brightly.
He hadn't been paying much attention up to this point. "I like game
shows! You know, you can really get into game shows!"
"I KNOW," Ernie interrupted. "That's what I'm AFRAID of!"
The man on the screen looked like a typical game show host,
wearing a plaid polyester suit with a large carnation in his lapel.
The only thing that seemed a bit odd about him is that he was
wearing jackboots and a monocle.
"Congratulations!" he was saying to an excited female
contestant. "You'fe von an all-expenses-paid dream date vit
bachelor number 3!" The game show host seemed to have a bit of a
German accent.
"Oh, I just can't wait to see him!" The young woman was
jumping up and down with excitement. 
"Bachelor number three, come on out!" The game show host
called out. A door opened, and out stepped a man, wearing a suit,
who had the enormously enlarged head of a fly. The young woman
began to scream.
Ernie looked confused. "Hey, what are we watching, anyway? Is
this THE FLY, or THE DATING GAME, or what?"
Captain Memory was looking at the TV Guide upside-down. "Mmm
hmm," he agreed, not paying much attention.
The host seemed to be wrapping the show up. "Vell folks, dis
is Biff Mozzarella, saying..."
"Wait a minute" Sterno interrupted. "I think something smells
around here!
Captain Memory looked up. "Got a problem?" he asked
unconcernedly.
"Think about it," Sterno considered. "His name: Mozzarella."
"Huh?" said Ernie. "You mean, Biff?"
"This guy's name is Mozzarella," Sterno noted. "The last guys
name was Liederkranz."
"So?" asked Ernie uncomprehendingly.
"Cheese, get it?" cried Sterno. "They're both cheese!" 
I don't think I like the sound of this, Ernie thought. "Um,
well, you know," he began to Captain Memory. "Maybe we ought to
give this some consideration..."
But it was too late. With a deafening roar, the delicate panel
doors to the room were blown off their hinges. A dozen armed men
rushed in, pointing wicked-looking weapons at the trio. "FREEZE!"
one of them shouted.
Captain Memory looked uncomprehending. "It seems a bit warm
for that," he commented.
The group of armed men parted to make way for an unpleasant
looking man wearing a black military uniform, jackboots, and a
monocle. "Zo, ve meet again!"
The man, did, in fact, look somewhat familiar to Ernie.
"Haven't I seen you somewhere before?"
The man smiled warmly. "No doubt you've seen my TV show. THE
TORTURE GAME is a big hit these days. I'm..." He drew himself up to
his full height. "Sturmbannfuhrer Dr. Heinz von Liederkranz, the
Gestapo's greatest." He paused; he seemed to be waiting for
applause. His men looked at each other quickly, and began clapping.
Ernie thought it might be a good idea if he applauded too.
"ENOUGH!" Von Liederkranz silenced his men with a quick sweep
of his riding crop, leaving Ernie applauding feebly all by himself.
Ernie looked around, and quickly stopped.
Von Liederkranz prodded Captain Memory in the chest with his
riding crop. "Now! You will tell us your name, rank and serial
number!"
"My what?" Captain Memory looked uncomprehending.
"Your name, rank, and serial number!"
"Name, rank and cereal number?" mused the Captain. "But I
never even eat cereal."
"Do not be coy with us!" snapped the Sturmbannfuhrer. "We know
you are one of Them! Ve know you are a spy on a mission of sabotage
and destruction!" He paused calculatingly. "Remember, ve have vays
of making you talk!"
Ernie turned to Captain Memory in confusion. "Who are these
guys, anyway?"
"They LOOK like a bunch of Nazis," the Captain replied
thoughtfully. "But they COULD be..."
"Enough!" von Liederkranz broke in. "You vill answer our
questions!"
Captain Memory concentrated. "How about: Who Put the Bop in
the Bop-Shu-Bop-Shu-Bop?" he suggested.
Von Liederkranz's tone abruptly changed. "You know," he turned
to Captain Memory. "Ve do not haff to be enemies. Ve could be
friends. You vould like to be friends, nein?"
"Sure." Captain Memory was nothing if not agreeable.
"Then tell us vot ve vant to know!"
"Okay." The Captain thought a minute. "The attack is set for
exactly 10:30. Julius Caesar will march on Omaha, and the
Enterprise will attack the Titanic somewhere in the South China
Sea. Then Patton will drive up through the south of France, make a
right onto Route 66, go down three stop lights, turn right and it's
the third house from the corner."
"Just as ve thought!" This, of course, was not what the
Sturmbannfuhrer had thought at all. However, he had to maintain a
good appearance in front of his men. He smiled amiably. "Please go
on!"
Captain Memory decided it was time to stop. "I think I've said
too much already!"
Von Liederkranz's face turned hard. "You misunderstand," he
said menacingly. "I'm not asking you, I'm TELLING YOU! TALK! NOW!!"
"I'd really rather not." Captain Memory didn't seem to be too
upset by the proceedings. Ernie, however, was beginning to sweat.
Sterno was glaring at the other two, giving them an I-told-you-so
look.
Von Liederkranz smiled sadistically. "You can't escape, you
know. Ve haff total control of all computation in zis sector. Ze
system vill not accept commands from anyone but me. Dere is no vay
out. Ve have you vhere ve vant you!"
"Well," Captain Memory began. "I'm afraid I don't have
time..."
"So be it!" cried von Liederkranz. "If dat's de vay you are
going to be - bring on de Hot Vhirling Corkscrew!"
Captain Memory looked pained. "You know, I really don't care
for the Hot Vhirling...I mean `Whirling' Corkscrew."
Von Liederkranz laughed sadistically. "You are very funny. Ve
vill see how funny you vill be after a few hours vit mein
Corkscrew!"
Captain Memory seemed offended. "Well, if you're going to be
like that, I'm simply going to have to leave."
Von Liederkranz laughed sadistically, again. In fact, he
didn't seem to be able to laugh any other way. "Dere is no way
out!" von Liederkranz continued. "You cannot break into ze system
from here!"
Ernie noticed his stomach beginning to hurt again. Stress, he
thought. It's not good for me to be under this much stress. I think
it's affecting my health. Maybe I'm getting an ulcer?
Von Liederkranz switched on his Hot Whirling Corkscrew, which,
true to it's name began to whirl and glow. Laughing sadistically,
as usual, he began to bring it closer and closer to Captain
Memory's face.
The torture device edged ever nearer, inch by inch, spinning
and hissing as it approached Captain Memory's unprotected face.
Ernie shut his eyes tightly. It's too horrible, he thought. I can't
watch. He waited for the inevitable screams.
Captain Memory looked miffed. "Okay, be like that! JMP 08F1!"
Ernie opened his eyes. The rococo sitting room had vanished.
They seemed to be back in the huge Chicago living room that they
had originally found themselves in after leaving the Simulation
Arcade. Ernie's head swam. This is all changing too fast for me, he
thought. I just can't keep up with it. He found a chair and sat
down. Ernie didn't feel well at all.
Captain Memory was strolling around, ruefully inspecting the
surroundings. "Look at this place," he lamented. "What a mess!"
Ernie looked about. The place, was, in fact, in dismal shape.
The walls were covered with soot, the furniture was singed. Much of
the furniture was knocked over; some was totally splintered. It
looked rather like a bomb had gone off in the room. Ernie recovered
enough composure to speak. "Why...why are we back here?"
"Oh, I apologize for that,"Captain Memory explained. "I just
couldn't think of anyplace else on such short notice. I should have
known this place would be a mess."
Ernie looked around. "Yeah, this place has really gone to the
dogs." 
"I suppose you think that's funny!" Sterno growled. 
Ernie noticed two piles of burned rags lying near the TV set.
They were still smoldering slightly. He shuddered. He would rather
not think about what might have happened here.
"Well...well," Ernie started again. "How did we get here? That
Nazi said we couldn't escape. He said they controlled all
computation in the sector!"
"That's right, Captain Memory smiled. "We JUMPed to a
different sector!"
Ernie decided to just accept that explanation, even though he
didn't entirely understand it.
"Makes about as much sense as anything else," Sterno agreed.
He seemed to have found another cigar, and was puffing away on it
contentedly. He seemed to be in a much better mood whenever he had
a cigar. "Pity you couldn't have transported that brandy along with
us, though."
Ernie was desperately trying to make sense of all of this.
"So, who were those Nazi guys, anyway?"
"That's hard to say for sure," CM said thoughtfully. "They're
probably Cyberslaves, just like you would have been if I hadn't
rescued you."
Ernie shuddered. He really didn't like the sound of that
`Cyberslave' stuff."
"What about their leader, Von Liederkranz?" Sterno wondered.
"He didn't look a slave. In fact, he seemed to be having a really
good time!"
The Captain nodded. "I'm sure he's not a slave," he agreed.
"He's one of the Slavemasters. In fact," Captain Memory furled his
brow in thought. "He MIGHT even be Waldo Stadium himself!"
"So, what are we doing in all of this?" Ernie wanted to know.
Sterno rolled his eyes upward. "Hopeless!"
"Don't pick on the kid!" Captain Memory defended Ernie.
"Yeah!" Ernie agreed.
"After all," Captain Memory continued. "It's not his fault
he's stupid!"
"Yeah, it's..." Ernie broke off. That wasn't turning out the
way he'd hoped. 
Sterno looked at the Captain. "So, what kind of super hero are
you supposed to be, anyway?"
"Me?" Captain Memory expounded. "Why I'm a strange visitor
from another planet who came to Earth with powers and abilities far
beyond those of mortal men."
"Powers and abilities?" Ernie wanted to know. "Like what?"
Captain Memory continued expansively. "I'm faster than a
speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotive; why, I can even
leap tall buildings in a single bound!"
This was beginning to sound a bit familiar to Ernie. "Anything
else?"
"I can also change the course of mighty rivers and bend steel
in my bare hands."
I've got it now, thought Ernie. "You don't, by any chance,
tend to go around disguised as Clark Kent, mild-mannered reporter
for a great metropolitan newspaper, and fight a never-ending battle
for truth, justice, and the American way, do you?"
Captain Memory looked totally mystified. "Why, no. Why would
I want to do a thing like that?"
Ernie was nonplussed. "Well...I dunno. I just sort of
thought..." He trailed off.
There was an awkward silence. Sterno cleared his throat. "You
don't suppose these people keep caviar about somewhere, do you?"
Grateful for the interruption, Ernie began searching. He found
a small white cabinet that looked like it might be a refrigerator.
"Ah!" He pulled out a small jar. "How's this?"
Sterno examined the jar ruefully. "Oh," he sniffed. "American
caviar. Well, I suppose Beluga was a bit too much to ask. We'll
just have to rough it, I imagine." He looked around. "You wouldn't
happen to have a slice of fresh onion, by any chance?"
Captain Memory had returned to perusing the TV Guide. "Wanna
watch some TV?" he asked brightly. "It's almost time for that great
game show about the dinosaur age."
"Which one is that?" Ernie couldn't recall any shows about
dinosaurs.
"Oh, I'm sure you've seen it. It's real famous!" the Captain
explained. "It's called YOU BET JURASSIC!"
Ernie frowned. Something about that name did seem a bit
familiar. All these familiar-sounding things that he couldn't quite
place were making him very uneasy. 
Suddenly, the television came on. "Prepare to die, inferior
creatures!" the speaker blared.
Ernie was annoyed. "I thought we turned that off!"
Captain Memory looked upset. "Oh, dear. I forgot about that!"
Ernie began to get that queasy feeling in his stomach again.
"Forgot about WHAT?"
The television screen showed a huge purple vegetable, lifting
itself up on a green stalk. It seemed to be gloating, insofar as a
vegetable can gloat. "You will soon respire your last, animal
scum!" the vegetable continued. "No longer shall we of the
vegetable kingdom be your helpless victims, to be bred and
destroyed at your whims! The day of reckoning is here at last!
Prepare to receive the Vengeance of the Vegetables!"
Ernie shifted his weight uncomfortably. "This sure is a weird
program."
"Oh, it's not a program," Captain Memory explained. "The
Killer Eggplants are about to attack!"
Ernie thought he'd better sit down again. "Huh?"
"I told you, we're in a game called `ATTACK OF THE KILLER
EGGPLANTS'!" Captain Memory regarded his bare wrist. "Oh dear, it's
been almost forty-five minutes."
Ernie didn't get it. "I don't get it," he said.
"Remember those nukes I told you about?"
Ernie didn't like the sound of this. He tried to put the
pieces together. "They're going to nuke us?"
"Afraid so," said Captain Memory cheerily. He didn't seem
particularly upset at the idea.
"WHY?!"
"To put an end to the Revolt of the Vegetables," Captain
Memory explained. "And fry the Great Eggplant once and for all!"
Ernie was trying hard to understand all of this. "let me get
this straight - you mean the vegetables have risen up in revolt?"
"Of course not!" Captain Memory laughed. "How could vegetables
possibly do a thing like that?"
Ernie was getting frustrated. "Then WHAT is GOING ON!?"
Captain Memory chuckled. "Oh, it's all a big practical joke!"
Ernie felt relieved. "Then they're NOT going to nuke Chicago?"
"Oh no, they're really going to do it." Captain Memory seemed
to think this was all very funny. "After all, they don't know it's
a joke, do they? It wouldn't be very funny if they KNEW it was a
joke, would it?" Captain Memory chuckled. "Nope, they're going to
bomb the whole city back to the Stone Age."
Ernie heard the sound of jets flying very close by outside. He
began to feel very uneasy. "So, um, what are we going to do?"
"Do?" asked Captain Memory innocently.
Ernie began to feel an intense heat radiating through the
walls. He clenched his eyes tightly closed. I'll just close my
eyes, he thought. Maybe when I open them again this will all be
gone.
He opened his eyes.
It was all gone.
Ernie was taken aback. Wow, he thought. It worked.
He looked around. They were in the midst of a grassy field,
studded with wildflowers. Bright sunshine bathed the scene. Captain
Memory was idly toying with blades of grass; Sterno was sniffing
the flowers.
"Where are we?" Ernie asked dumbly.
"Why, the Stone Age, of course." Captain Memory seemed to
think this was quite obvious. "Somewhere in the Jurassic period, I
think."
"You knew this would happen?" Ernie cried.
"Sure," replied the Captain offhandedly. "It's part of the
game!"
Ernie sighed. A gentle breeze swayed the tall grass. He could
hear birdsongs in the distance. It all seemed very peaceful. Good,
thought Ernie. I could use a break. He lay down in the grass and
rested. At least, he thought, we won't have to watch any TV.
The sun moved slowly across the sky as the hours passed. After
a time, Ernie sat up. It occurred to him that he might be getting
a sunburn. "So, what are we gonna do in the Stone Age?" he asked. 
"Get stoned?" Sterno offered.
Captain Memory looked at his bare wrist. "I'm glad you
mentioned that," he said. "It's time we were on our way."
I knew I shouldn't have said anything, Ernie thought. Oh well,
it's too late now. "So now what?"
"We'd better find a cave before it gets dark, don't you
think?" Captain Memory said cheerily. "Wouldn't want to have a run-
in with one of those saber-tooth tigers, would we?" 
Ernie frowned. He had forgotten that there would be things
like saber-tooth tigers in the Stone Age, although he supposed he
should have realized that. It suddenly occurred to him that Stone
Age caves often held giant cave bears. "Um, maybe we should think
about this," he called out to Captain Memory. The Captain, however,
was already far ahead of Ernie, striding purposefully towards a
ridge of white cliffs in the distance. He seemed not to hear Ernie,
or, if he did, he paid no attention. Ernie hurried to catch up.
"At least you're properly dressed for the occasion," Sterno
commented to Ernie. "I understand fur loincloths are all the rage
this year." Sterno snickered.
Ernie looked down at his garment. He had been wearing it so
long he had sort of forgotten about it.
"If we run into any saber-tooth tigers," Sterno continued.
"You can just chop them up with your plastic broadsword." Sterno
laughed unpleasantly.
"Are you still carrying that thing?" Captain Memory called,
without looking back.
"Hey, it's a forty buck deposit, okay?" Ernie sensed that they
were both laughing at him. "Gimme a break, huh?"
"Hopeless, just hopeless," Sterno muttered, amused.
Ernie began to be able to make out an odd looking object in
the distance. It seemed to be some sort of primitive building. As
they approached, Ernie began to see it more clearly. It seemed to
be a house, made out of huge slabs of stone. Holes were cut in the
front slab for windows and a door. A huge flat slab made up the
roof. Sitting outside the house was a very odd object. It was a
wooden framework connected to two huge stone rollers. There was a
seat on the framework, and a piece of fur held up above the seat,
creating a primitive roof.
"How odd," commented Sterno. "Some sort of totem object, no
doubt. Perhaps a throne of some sort?"
They approached the house. It began to look a bit familiar to
Ernie. Those fur curtains on the windows, where had he seen those
before? A neat walk led toward the front door. At the end of the
walk was a stone box, held up on a pole. There was something
written on the box. The name confirmed Ernie's worst fears: "F.
FLINTSTONE".
"Hey guys!" Ernie called out.
"Hmm?" returned Captain Memory, continuing to walk toward the
house. He was, as usual, not paying much attention to Ernie.
"Um, I don't think we should go in there!"
"Why not?" Captain Memory did not even slow down.
"I've got a real bad feeling about this place!"
"Aww, is the big, strong barbarian afraid of the little
house?" sneered Sterno. "Well, then he can just stay out here with
the saber-tooth tigers if he likes." The two of them continued into
the house, leaving Ernie standing alone on the front walk. Ernie
looked around. The sun was slowly edging towards the horizon,
casting long, menacing-looking shadows. Ernie found himself
anxiously looking around for places large enough for a saber-tooth
tiger to hide in. Well, he thought. There's not much point in
standing here. I might as well go in.
Stepping inside the doorway, Ernie found himself in a living
room, appointed with furniture made of stone and wood. Captain
Memory and Sterno had made themselves comfortable on the stone-and-
fur sofa. The owners of the house were nowhere in sight.
"Rather luxurious for the Stone Age, don't you think?"
commented Sterno. Captain Memory was, once again, engrossed in his
copy of the TV Guide. Ernie noticed, across from the sofa, what
appeared to be a roughly carved, stone television set. He moaned.
"Whatever is the matter!" said Sterno impatiently.
"Hey guys," Ernie implored. "I really think we ought to get
out of here. I think this is some kind of a trap, or something."
Sterno rolled his eyes upward. "Paranoia," he commented. "The
poor creature would like to think he's important enough for anyone
to bother persecuting." He turned to Ernie. "Who in the world would
want to lay a trap for you? What possible use could they have for
you if they caught you?"
Ernie shifted back and forth uncomfortably. Suddenly, an
object caught his eye. "Paranoia, huh?" he demanded. "What about
THAT!" He pointed to an object in a dark corner.
Ernie's exclamation was enough to tear Captain Memory's
attention away from his TV Guide. He peered at the object. It was
a box with what appeared to be a lens attached to it. As they
looked at it, it whirred quietly, moving the lens back and forth.
"It's a hidden camera!" Ernie cried triumphantly. "We're being
watched!"
Sterno was nonplussed. "Where did that come from?"
"Well, tear it out, then!" Captain Memory said.
Ernie strode over to the dark corner, grabbed to camera and
yanked it out of it's mounting. He dashed it to the ground, where
it shattered, revealing feebly glowing electronic parts which
slowly, one by one, went out.
"Well, so much for that," Captain Memory returned to the TV
Guide. 
"Is that ALL?!" exclaimed Ernie.
"Well, what else did you want?" asked Captain Memory,
mystified.
"Look, I just proved to you that this is some kind of a trap
or something!" cried Ernie exasperatedly. "There was a hidden
camera watching us, for heaven's sake!"
"So, you took it out." Captain Memory seemed perfectly
satisfied. "So much for that."
Ernie was getting very frustrated. "Well, well, what if
there's another?"
"Oh, I very much doubt that," Sterno commented.
Captain Memory was still studying his TV Guide. "Wanna watch
some TV?" he asked brightly.
"NO!" Ernie was building up a real aversion to television.
"Why not?" Captain Memory couldn't imagine why anyone would
not want to watch TV.
"Look," said Ernie desperately. "This is the Stone Age, right?
There aren't supposed to be any TVs here. They haven't been
invented yet. This is before television!"
Captain Memory chuckled."Don't be silly! No time is before
television!" He got up and walked over to the set.
"How primitive," Sterno commented. "No remote control. That's
only to be expected in the Stone Age, I suppose."
"Look," said Ernie urgently. "I'm positive there were no
televisions in the Stone Age!"
Captain Memory sighed. "Be reasonable," he said. "have you
ever seen, oh, let's say `I Was a Teenage Caveman'?"
Ernie thought a moment. "Um, yes."
"Where did you see it?"
"On TV."
"It takes place in the Stone Age, right?"
"Um, yeah." Ernie wasn't sure he liked the way this line of
questioning was going.
"Well, how could that be, UNLESS THERE WERE TELEVISIONS IN THE
STONE AGE!?" Captain Memory cried triumphantly. "I rest my case."
Sterno applauded. "Bravo," he said politely.
"Well...well..." Ernie was sure there was something wrong with
this argument, but he couldn't quite figure out what it was. He
noticed that no-one was listening to him anyway.
Captain Memory switched on the television. Being a primitive
set, it took a long time to warm up.
A picture of a room very much like the one the three were in
appeared on the television screen, taken from an odd angle.
"Eww, black-and-white," sniffed Sterno. "This really is the
Stone Age, isn't it?"
Ernie stared at the picture. A man in a comic-book-character
outfit, accompanied by a dog, entered the room, and they both sat
down. After a short wait, another figure, clad in a fur loincloth
and carrying a large plastic broadsword, also entered. The
characters seemed to be conversing, but their voices were too
indistinct to understand.
"I can't hear what they're saying," Captain Memory said.
"Seems to be a sound problem," Sterno sniffed. "Only to be
expected from prehistoric TV stations."
Suddenly, one of the characters pointed directly at them.
"...hidden camera!" They heard the figure say. "We're being
watched!" The other characters said something indistinct. The
figure in the loincloth loomed larger and larger in the picture,
until finally the screen was entirely taken up by a face not unlike
Ernie's own. A huge hand loomed up over the screen, and the picture
went dead.
Ernie looked at the dead television screen. "I don't like the
looks of this at all," he said warily.
"Neither do I," agreed Captain Memory. "Let's watch something
else." He changed the channel.
A different scene appeared. In it, two men were seated at a
large array of electronic equipment, their backs to the audience.
They were peering intently at their devices, and conversing.
"Looks like they found the hidden camera," one said to the
other.
"What are we gonna do?"
"Let's switch over to the second camera."
"What if they find that one?"
"They won't. They don't suspect a thing."
The two men flipped some switches. "Here we go," said the
first. "Wanna see it?"
"Sure." The man flipped a switch. Suddenly, the scene changed
back to the room suspiciously like their own. The figure in the
loincloth appeared upset.
"Hey!" cried Ernie. "`Hey!'" cried the loincloth-clad figure
on the television. "That's us!" "`That's us!'" echoed his TV image.
Captain Memory regarded the television picture. "Not a very
interesting show," he commented, echoed a moment later by the
comic-book-clad character on the television. "Seems a bit
repetitious. Might as well turn it off."
"Wait!" Ernie cried, but it was too late. Captain Memory had
already shut off the set.
Captain Memory was confused. "Wait? I thought you didn't want
to watch TV? I just turned it off to be nice. I can turn it back on
if you want." He reached toward the set.
"NO! No, uh that's okay. Uh, thanks. I'd just as soon we
didn't watch anything right now, if you don't mind." Ernie was not
prepared for the possible consequences of turning on the TV again.
He had more than enough to deal with as it was.
Ernie gathered up his thoughts. "Okay, guys, look. I gotta
tell you something. This place is not what it seems!"
"Really." Captain Memory had returned to the study of his
favorite reading matter, the TV Guide.
Ernie continued. "This isn't a typical Stone Age house, okay?
It's actually a set from a 1960's cartoon series called`The
Flintstones.'"
"Oh, we know THAT," Captain Memory commented, not bothering to
look up.
"You DO?!" Ernie was upset. "Well, well, why didn't you SAY
something!?"
"You didn't ask."
Sterno was considering something Ernie had said a few moments
earlier. "What makes you think `The Flintstones' isn't typical of
the Stone Age?"
Ernie dropped into a chair. This was getting to be to much for
him, he thought. The more he argued about all of this, the more he
seemed to be losing ground. He wasn't even sure what point he was
losing ground on.
Ernie decided to try another approach. "Okay, I give up. You
tell me, then: What is going on?"
"Oh, you want to know what's going on!" said the Captain
brightly. He always enjoyed telling stories. "Why didn't you say
so! Well," he went on, warming up to his subject. "All of this is
totally artificial. It was put here to be a trap..."
"That's what I was trying to tell you!" cried Ernie excitedly.
"It's a trap! I knew it!"
Captain Memory was annoyed. "Do you want to hear this or do
you want to talk?"
"Sorry." Ernie shut up.
"Where was I?" Captain Memory gathered his thoughts. "Oh yes.
Anyway, this is part of a game called `THE FLINTSTONES', in which
Fred and Barney thwart an attempt by aliens to take over the Earth
back in the Stone Age. It's really quite elaborate."
"An excellent game," Sterno added. "I've played it myself."
"Anyway," Captain Memory continued. "This house is actually a
trap set by the aliens to try to capture Earth people. We knew
that, but we thought we'd come in here anyway, because it's more
comfortable than a cave, don't you think?"
"Aha!" cried Sterno.
"What?!" Ernie was startled.
"Cigars!" Sterno had found a stone jar, and opened it. He
pulled out a cigar and examined it, sniffing it carefully. "They're
not very good, but I suppose they'll have to do. One must, after
all, make allowances in the Stone Age." He lit one, puffing little
clouds of blue smoke into the air. Captain Memory returned to the
TV Guide.
"So, what about these aliens?" Ernie inquired. "What do they
want?"
"Oh, I don't know. Typical alien stuff, I imagine. `Take me to
your leader', conquer the world, steal your brain. You know, all
that stuff aliens always do."
Ernie was mystified. "But why?"
"Oh, I don't know. Probably from watching old science fiction
movies on TV. The aliens seem to think that sort of thing is
expected of them."
Ernie wasn't following this. "Watching TV? Aliens watch TV?"
"Of course," Captain Memory went on. "You'd have to expect
something like that to happen. After all, we've been beaming those
radio and television waves out into outer space for years. It was
only a matter of time until someone picked them up. Do you realize
that there are civilizations forty light years from here that are
now watching 1950's situation comedies? What do you suppose they
think of that?"
"Well..." Ernie began.
"Did you ever think that they might consider it a hostile
act?" Captain Memory continued animatedly. "They might think having
"I Love Lucy" reruns beamed at them is an act of war."
"Huh?" Ernie wasn't following this too well.
"Well, look at it from their point of view," Captain Memory
explained. "Here they are, they come home from a hard day at, well,
whatever it is they do, they just wanna watch a little TV, you
know? So they flip on their set, and what do they get? `Mr. Ed',
`The Flintstones', `I Love Lucy'! They don't wanna watch this! They
wanna watch, you know, ALIEN shows!"
Ernie considered this. "I Love Lucy, huh? Well, I can see
their point."
"So maybe they decide to flip on the stereo," Captain Memory
continued. "And what do they get? The Chiffons, the Ronettes, Chuck
Berry! Maybe they don't like rock n' roll! Did you ever think of
that?"
"No," Ernie was amazed. "I thought everybody liked rock n'
roll!"
Captain Memory shook his head sadly. "You can't take anything
for granted in Outer Space."
Ernie found this disturbing. "Maybe it wasn't such a good idea
to let all those TV waves get out into space, then."
"Probably not," agreed Captain Memory. "But, it's too late
now. We'll just have to deal with the consequences."
Ernie didn't like that word `consequences.' He would rather
not think about what the `consequences' of all of this might be. He
rubbed his head. He especially didn't like that `steal your brain'
business.
"So, what are we gonna do?" Ernie wanted to know.
"Do?" repeated Captain Memory distantly. He had returned to
reading.
Ernie heard a shout far in the distance. He strained his ears.
There it was again! It sounded like...`Yabba-dabba-doo?'
"Look, I think we ought to get out of here," Ernie pleaded. "I
think something bad is gonna happen if we don't leave, like, right
now!"
"Oh, my! What a coincidence!" cried Captain Memory.
"What now?" Ernie asked uneasily.
"You'll never guess what's on! And here we were, talking about
almost that very thing just a moment ago!"
Ernie had a bad feeling about this. "Not..."
"That's right!" returned Captain Memory jovially. "TRUTH OR
CONSEQUENCES!"
"I really don't wanna watch..." But it was too late. Captain
Memory had already flipped on the set.
The set came on. "...and here's our host," the announcer was
saying. "That fabulous Frenchman, Henri Gruyere!"
"This isn't the `Truth or Consequences' I remember!" said
Ernie suspiciously. As usual, no-one was listening.
"Gut efening, ladies und gentlemen!" the host was saying. He
was an unpleasant-looking man wearing a traditional French outfit:
red-striped shirt, scarf, beret. The only things that seemed a bit
out of place were his monocle and jackboots.
"First of all," he continued. "I vould like to point out dot
I am French. I am not German. Not at all. Not efen a little bit."
"Wait a minute," said Sterno suspiciously. " Something smells
here!"
"Hmm?" Captain Memory looked up unconcernedly.
"Think about it!" cried Sterno. "Don't you realize..!? His
name! Gruyere! It's...CHEESE!"
But, it was, as usual, too late. Sudden brightness dazzled
Ernie's eyes. As his vision cleared, he found himself standing on
a game-show stage, with Captain Memory and Sterno beside him. He
blinked and staggered, disoriented by the sudden change of scene.
He moaned and held his head until the sickening swimming sensation
stopped.
Ernie looked up. He was facing the audience. He noticed
something odd about the people watching. Oh, that's it, he thought.
They're all wearing Nazi uniforms.
"I thought you said this couldn't happen," he said to Captain
Memory accusingly. "I thought you said there was a million-to-one
chance of us getting sucked in through a TV again!"
Captain memory shrugged. "So I was wrong," he admitted. "So
sue me!"
The game shoe host turned to the threesome. "Perhaps you vould
like to step through door number three?" the host said to them.
Ernie turned around. A number of very nice prizes were
displayed on the stage: a red sports car, furniture, some shiny new
appliances. Several very attractive women in cut-down outfits were
standing around the stage. Unfortunately, they all carried guns,
which they held trained on Ernie and the others.
Captain Memory was replying to the talk show host, "No, I
don't think we would care to step through door number three. Thanks
just the same."
The talk show host laughed unpleasantly. "I vould strongly
recommend dot you step through door number three!" he said
urgently.
"No, we'd really rather not," answered the Captain pleasantly.
The host's face darkened. "You vill shtep through dat door!
NOW!" The women's fingers tightened menacingly on their triggers.
"Oh, well, if you put it that way," the three of them found
themselves prodded towards door number three. The door opened in
front of them, and they found themselves thrust into blackness. The
door slammed behind them with a resounding crash. 
Ernie blinked. As his eyes began to adjust, he could see that
the room they were in was not entirely dark. A small amount of
light came in from a barred window high up on the opposite wall.
They were in a large chamber with damp stone walls and a dirt
floor. It seemed to be...a dungeon.
"Oh great," Ernie muttered. "So this is what's behind door
number three!"
"It could've been worse," said Captain Memory jovially.
"Oh yeah?" Ernie returned glumly. "How?"
"It could've been door number four."
"So? What's the big deal about door number four?"
"Oh," Captain Memory shook his head. "You don't ever want to
go behind door number four!"
Ernie didn't like the sound of that. "So, what is it?"
"It's the worst," Captain Memory went on ominously. "I mean,
it's just too horrible..."
A voice came from out of the darkness. "Hi, guys!"
Ernie was taken aback. It hadn't occurred to him that someone
else might be in the dungeon with them.
A figure approached from out of the darkness. Ernie gasped. It
was a horrendous creature with the body of a human, but the
tremendously enlarged head of a fly, complete with huge, faceted
eyes, antennae, and a long, trunk-like snout. It was wearing rather
a nice designer suit. "Say," the creature continued. "Have any of
you guys seen my date?"
Ernie stared soundlessly.
Captain Memory shrugged. "Sorry."
The creature sighed. "She seemed like such a nice girl, too."
The creature shuffled back and forth, scuffing his expensive
designer shoes in the dirt.
Ernie peered at the creature. He didn't seem to be menacing at
all. Quite the contrary. In fact, he seemed quite unhappy. But then
again, Ernie thought, it's kind of hard to read expressions on a
fly.
"Aww, that's okay, guys," the Fly said sadly. "You don't have
to tell me. I can figure it out. She took off, right?" He sighed.
"Just like all the others." 
Poor guy, Ernie thought. His date stood him up. Ernie could
sympathize; he'd been in situations like that himself. Of course,
this guy did have an unusual problem.
"I know," the Fly continued. "It's my looks, right?" His
antennae drooped sadly. "One little accident, and there goes your
whole social life."
Ernie felt awkward. What was he expected to say in a situation
like this?
Nothing, apparently, for the Fly went on: "I mean, I've got a
nice personality, I'm intelligent, I'm a fun guy, you know? I got
a good job, a nice car, I paid a lotta money for this suit." He
fingered the expensive silk lapels. "But girls nowadays, do they
care? Naw, all they care about is looks!" The Fly continued
animatedly. He really seemed to appreciate the opportunity to get
all of this off his chest. "I mean, I go into a bar, you know, not
one of those sleazy places, but a nice singles spot, where the
drinks cost like five bucks each, you know? I figure, maybe I can
meet some nice girls here. So, I see some cute chick, I try to
start up a conversation, and, like, does she even give me a chance?
Hell, no! I mean, she doesn't even wait to find out, like, what I'm
all about or anything. It's just `gasp, scream, faint,' `gasp,
scream, faint,' the same old thing over and over again. I mean,
what kind of a way is that to behave?Don't girls have any manners
anymore?" He sighed. "Looks. All they care about is looks."
"Gee, that's...too bad," Ernie really didn't know what to say.
"Thanks, guy," the Fly answered. "I really appreciate it. I
don't get to talk to too many people around here, you know?"
A disturbing thought occurred to Ernie. "Is this guy okay?" he
whispered to Captain Memory. "I mean, he's not an alien or
anything, is he?"
"Oh, no," laughed Captain Memory. "He's the Fly! You saw the
movie, didn't you?"
"Well, yeah," admitted Ernie. "But I thought it was, well, a
movie!"
"You see?" replied Captain Memory. "I told you it could be
worse. At least you're trapped in Cyperspace as yourself. He's
trapped as the Fly!"
Ernie had to admit that the Captain was right about that.
Still, it didn't make him fell much better.
"Anyway," continued Captain Memory, looking at the Fly. "The
aliens are much prettier."
"I say," said Sterno to the Fly. "You wouldn't happen to have
a cigar on you by any chance, would you?"
"Sure, guy," the Fly pulled out an expensive gold cigar case
and flipped it open. 
Sterno removed a cigar and examined it. "Lovely!" He seemed
very pleased. "Havana, no less! Thanks ever so much!"
"Hey, my pleasure," The Fly seemed to enjoy the opportunity to
show off his fine-quality things. It seemed to Ernie that the Fly
had gone to a lot of trouble to get the best of everything, but
didn't have much opportunity to impress people with it.
"Are we going to be leaving here soon?" Sterno inquired of
Captain Memory. "It is awfully damp in here, and it rather bothers
my sinuses."
Ernie shivered. The dampness was getting to him, too. Wearing
only a loincloth as he was, he had little protection from the
chill.
"Hey, I like the loincloth, guy," the Fly said to Ernie.
"That`s the new `in' thing, right? Maybe I'll get one. You think
the girls would go for it?" Ernie didn't know how to reply.
"Well, I guess there's no point in hanging around here much
longer," Captain Memory decided. "After all, there's no TV."
"You guys gonna leave?" The Fly seemed crestfallen, or
perhaps, antenna-fallen. "But you just got here!" He brightened.
"Hey, you guys are gonna go someplace fun, right? Can I come? Huh?
Can I?"
"Well..." Captain Memory began.
"Do you know how we can get out of here?" Sterno inquired.
"Hey, no problem!" answered the Fly. "You can take the 5:15
out of LaGuardia, and that'll get you there in about, oh, two hours
forty minutes, but if you want the special rate you gotta stay from
Sunday through Saturday but not any Mondays, or you can take the
6:25 out of O'Hare, but then you gotta..."
"What about the door?" Ernie broke in.
"Oh." The Fly was disappointed. He enjoyed showing off his
detailed knowledge of travel arrangements. "Yeah, well, there's
always the door."
Ernie looked at the door. It was made of heavy steel, and
seemed to be secure bolted. "So, how do we open it?"
"Just knock." The Fly seemed to think this was all too simple,
and therefore not very much fun.
Ernie knocked. He heard the sound of a bolt being thrown back,
and the door creaked open. Outside were two burly guards in black
Nazi SS uniforms. "Ja?"
"Uh, is it okay if we go now?" Ernie asked brightly.
"NEIN!" The door slammed.
"Oh, not like that!" The Fly seemed impatient. "You gotta use,
like, subterfuge, you know? Here, I'll show you!" The Fly was
pleased to have another opportunity to show off his expertise at
something. He knocked on the door.
The door creaked open again. "Ja?"
"I gotta go to the bathroom!" the Fly said urgently.
The guards looked at each other. "Vhat are ve supposed to do
now? Dey didn't tell us vhat to do if dis happened." They looked
hesitant. "Vell, I don't know. I don't tink so..."
Sensing failure, the Fly quickly switched tactics. "Hey,
look!" he cried, pointing past the guards. "A naked lady!"
"Vhere?! VHERE?!" cried the guards, peering into the distance.
The Fly threw his entire weight against the door, which flew open.
"RUN!" he cried to the others. He sprinted toward center stage,
followed by Ernie, Sterno, and Captain Memory.
A startled von Liederkranz was on center stage, trying to
flirt with the chorus girls. "Guards!" he cried. "Don't let dem get
avay!" He grabbed the nearest weapon, which, in this case happened
to be an alien Blaster of unknown properties. He aimed it at the
foursome, who were sprinting towards a door marked "EXIT". "Shtop,
or I'll shoot!" Von Liederkranz threatened. The four continued to
run. Von Liederkranz pulled the trigger.
A huge ball of magneto-gravitational energy flashed from the
muzzle of the Blaster, instantly hurtling Ernie and the others into
a totally different Space-Time Continuum. 
Von Liederkranz looked ruefully at the Blaster, and then at
the smoking hole in the stage where the foursome had been only a
nanosecond earlier. "Vell," von Liederkranz admitted. "Perhaps dot
vasn't der best veapon to use."



Chapter 3

Ernie, Captain Memory, Sterno, and the Fly sat on a rocky
crag, overlooking a lifeless purple sea. They watched the waves
crash against the rocks beneath them.
Ernie sighed. "So, where are we now?"
"Well, as far as I can figure out," said Captain Memory
thoughtfully. "We seem to have been blasted back to somewhere on
the order of four billion B.C. Life has not evolved yet on Earth."
"Huh?" said Ernie. "You mean, we traveled in time?"
"Of course not," the Captain replied. "What really happened is
that we got sent to another sector of Cyberspace. Probably by
accident." Captain Memory looked around. "After all, I can't see
any reason for Von Liederkranz to have sent us here on purpose!"
Ernie looked out over the purple waves. "So, where ARE we? I
mean, really?"
Captain Memory thought a moment. "We're probably in somebody's
Geology program. You know, like computer models of primeval Earth?"
He looked at the barren landscape. "While we didn't actually travel
in time, it's almost as if we did. This is like actually being on
Earth at the beginning of life."
Wow, thought Ernie. That's really cosmic.
The Fly looked at the bare rocks around them. "You know, man,
this place is, like, really dead."
"Exactly," Captain Memory agreed.
"I mean," the Fly went on. "There is, like, no girls. None at
all."
"That's right."
"So, like, what good is it?"
Captain Memory thought a moment. "Good question."
Ernie watched the orange sun, in a green sky, which was slowly
setting against a purple sea. "This is really a weird scene," he
commented. "I have never seen anything like this. Not even on TV."
He thought about that for a moment. "Not even on TV? Why, that
could mean that there's..."
"No TV," Captain Memory agreed. "Not much reason to stay here
then, is there?"
Ernie noticed a motion out of the corner of his eye. "I'm not
sure you ought to throw those cigar butts on the ground here," he
said to Sterno.
Sterno looked annoyed. "Why in the world not?"
"Well, I don't know that much about this," Ernie said. "But it
seems to me I read somewhere that the further you go back in time,
the more effect your actions have on the future. Therefore, if we
make even little changes way back here in four billion B.C., it
might have some kind of real big effect by the time we get back to
our own time."
"Utterly ridiculous," scoffed Sterno, flicking cigar ash into
the sea."This isn't REALLY four billion B.C., it's only a computer
model of four billion B.C."
"Well, yeah," Ernie admitted uneasily. "But the Captain said
that this was almost the same as really being there. And, I dunno,
I just have a real bad feeling about those cigar butts." 
"Really." Sterno looked totally bored. "I just can't tell you
how concerned that makes me." He yawned.
"Well, well, I just don't think it's a good idea, that's all."
"Well, you know how it goes," said Captain Memory jovially.
"It's all just six of one, twelve dozen of another."
Ernie frowned. "I don't think that's right.
"Isn't it? Oh well," said Captain Memory cheerily. "Math was
never one of my strong points. Anyway, no time to worry about that
now. Let's be off, shall we?"He though a moment. "Let's try some
Machine Language: 010F E4 61." The scene vanished.

***

The foursome found themselves standing in the middle of a road
in bright sunlight. Once again, Ernie blinked and staggered, his
stomach doing flip-flops. As his vision cleared, He could see
around him what appeared to be an idyllic country scene. A rustic
rail fence bordered the road. Beyond the fence stood farms,
surrounded by fields full of amber waves of grain. In the distance
stood majestic purple mountains. Ernie turned around. Behind them
lay a broad plain. Ernie was pretty sure there was fruit on it.
"I wonder where we are?" the Fly asked.
Sterno looked around. "Kansas?" he suggested.
Ernie began to get that queasy feeling in the pit of his
stomach again. A look down confirmed his worst fears: the road was
yellow brick.
"I don't think I like this," said Ernie warily.
Sterno rolled his eyes upward. "You never like anything!"
Ernie tried to explain. "Well, you see..."
"I know, I know," Sterno interrupted. "You have a really bad
feeling about this. You've seen it all before. You think it's a
trap."
Ernie thought a moment. "Well...yeah."
Sterno sighed. "You know, this is all becoming really
tiresome. I do SO wish you'd find something else to go on about!"
Ernie thought a moment. Suddenly, he smiled broadly. "Hey, I
get it! This is all really just a game, right?"
Sterno moaned. "Not THAT again!" Even Captain Memory looked
annoyed.
The Fly was confused. "Like, what is this guy talking about?"
he asked Captain Memory. The Captain just rolled his eyes upward
and made little spinning motions around his temple with his
forefinger.
"Oh, wow," the Fly went on. "So is this guy, like, crazy, or
what?"
"Well, you know how it is," Captain Memory explained, not
unsympathetically. "Some people just don't deal well with travel.
It's too stressful for them. It upsets their systems."
"Oh, wow," said the Fly compassionately. "Poor guy."
Ernie was annoyed. "Awright, you guys, knock it off, okay? I
mean, enough is enough, all right?" Actually, he thought there was
probably quite a bit of truth to what CaptainMemory had been
saying. The stress probably WAS upsetting his system. However, even
if he agreed with what the Captain had to say, he resented his tone
of voice.
"So, like, what are we gonna do now, guys?" the Fly wanted to
know.
"Well," the Captain began jovially. "I guess we'll just have
to follow the..."
"DON'T SAY IT!" Ernie broke in. "Okay?! Just don't say it!"
"Touchy, touchy," sniffed Sterno.
Captain Memory was somewhat taken aback. "Well...have it your
way. Let's go that way." He gestured down the road.
The Fly shook his head. "I shoulda known. Anybody who'd wear
a loincloth like that..." He noticed Ernie glaring at him, and
stopped. "Hey, no offense..." He shrugged.
Ernie scowled.
They began walking down the road. Ernie peered ahead. Far
ahead down the road, he seemed to see something large and green.
Big and green?, Ernie thought. Is that, the Emerald...?
Suddenly, Ernie had an idea. He stopped, clicked his heels
together three times, clenched his eyes tightly shut, and said
"There's no place like home. There's no place like home. There's no
place like home!"
He opened his eyes. The other three were standing around him,
staring. "What is WRONG with you?!" Sterno demanded.
Ernie was acutely aware of everyone watching him. "I'm having
a bad day, okay?" he said defensively. "Just leave me alone!" He
began walking forward again, quickly.
"My, aren't we sensitive today!" Sterno said snidely.
The Fly shook his head sadly. "The human mind is such a
fragile thing!"
They proceeded down the road. The green object in the distance
began to resolve itself into some kind of building. Ernie continued
to be very unhappy about the entire situation, but decided he was
sick of being made fun of, and said nothing.
They approached the green building. It was done in Greek-
revival style, with huge Classical columns in the front. "Hey, it's
a bank!" noticed the Fly. "Do you suppose I can cash a check?"
The letters carved into the Greek-style pediment of the
building did, in fact, identify it as a bank. Ernie was confused.
He hadn't expected to find a bank here.
"Why would there be a bank here?" Ernie asked incredulously.
Captain Memory regarded the building. "Looks like we might
have run into a piece of somebody's business program. Accounting,
or bank operations or something." He shook his head. "That's what
happens when you start sticking a bunch of unrelated systems
together. You never know WHAT you're going to wind up with!"
They proceeded up the long, marble stairway and entered the
bank. The interior was huge and very ornate, done in Victorian
style. Everything seemed antique, as though the bank were right out
of the 19th century. They walked up to a row of teller's windows,
each of which was protected by elaborate Victorian grillwork. 
The Fly pulled a very nice quality leather checkbook out of
his suit pocket. "Hey," he said to the teller, a rather prim-
looking young woman. "Can you cash a check?"
"I'm sorry, we can't." She didn't really seem to be sorry at
all. "We can't do anything right now.Our computers are down."
Ernie looked around. He saw men at high desks carefully
copying numbers with long quill pens. Nowhere was there any sign of
electricity, much less computers. "You don't have any computers,"
Ernie said suspiciously.
The teller's expression turned ugly. "Well, we're still not
going to cash your check," she snapped.
"Why not?" The Fly wanted to know.
"We can't do any business. Our...our accountant has gone
crazy!" she concluded triumphantly.
Ernie looked at the teller suspiciously. Something very
peculiar was going on here. However, he decided not to say anything
about it because he didn't want to be made fun of.
"I wanna talk to the manager," the Fly decided.
"Good," the teller sneered. "The manager would like to talk to
all of you, RIGHT NOW!"
The teller came out from behind the counter and led them all
into a room which looked very much like a bank office. There,
behind a very large desk, sat a disagreeable-looking old woman with
a sour expression. Ernie somehow knew that the woman had something
unpleasant in mind for them.
"Well, it's about time!" she snapped as they entered the room.
"There's a little matter of an unpaid balance to be taken care of!"
Ernie looked at the woman. She was wearing a severely tailored
grey suit, with her greying hair pulled back in a tight bun. For
some reason, however, she was wearing shoes that didn't match her
outfit. They were a brilliant, sparkling red.
The Fly approached the desk. "Hey, I got this check..."
"Just one minute!" The manager cut him off rudely. "There's a
little matter to be taken care of first!" She pulled out a sheaf of
papers. "We have an invoice here for `Time Continuum Repair and
Reality Maintenance' which was referred to our department for non-
payment. Which of you is going to take care of this matter?"
Sterno was becoming impatient. "What ARE you talking about?"
The manager began reading from the papers. "It seems there was
a little problem with cigars butts left at four billion B.C."
Ernie glared at Sterno, who looked innocently off into the air,
twiddling his thumbs. "It seems these foreign materials left at
such an early point caused slime creatures to evolve into the
dominant life form on Earth. Precluding this disgusting development
required a maintenance order which took, let me see," she flipped
through the pages and pulled out a sheet marked "Work Order". "Here
it is: one million, two hundred and fifty-two thousand and three
standard Earth years, and forty-five minutes. Now, at $39.75 per
hour, plus time-and-a-half for overtime, and double-time on
Sundays, that comes to," she flipped through some more pages "One
hundred and ninety-five quadrillion, four hundred and twelve
trillion, seven hundred and seventy-one billion, two hundred and
thirteen million, three hundred and twelve thousand and thirty-two
dollars and twenty-nine cents." She peered at Captain Memory.
"Would you like to take care of this balance at this time?"
Captain Memory shrugged. "Don't look at me! I don't have any
money."
The manager peered at the Fly, who looked uncomfortable. "Hey,
sorry, but I got obligations, you know? I got car payments, I gotta
pay the rent..." He trailed off.
The bank manager looked at Ernie. Ernie laughed. This was all
just too ridiculous. "Sure, put it on my charge," he said
flippantly.
The bank manager smiled maliciously. "Mr. Ernest Ross," she
said in an disagreeable tone of voice, carefully writing his name
on the invoice with a quill pen.
Captain Memory looked at Ernie, horrified. "Oh, you shouldn't
have said that," he said in an ominous tone.
Ernie began to get the feeling that maybe he had made a big
mistake. The bank manager looked up at him. "Now, when may we
expect payment?"
Ernie looked desperately to the others. They were all
pointedly ignoring him. "Look," he said urgently. "Forget I said
that, okay? I take it back!"
"Oh, I'm sorry," she said in a tone of malicious sweetness.
"I'm afraid you can't do that. Now, will you be paying in cash or
by check?"
"A hundred and ninety-five quadrillion dollars," said the Fly
wonderingly. "That's a lot of money. That's more than I make in a
week!"
Ernie was beginning to panic. "No! I won't! Forget it! I'm not
going to pay that bill!" 
"You'll pay this bill, my fine little friend," the bank
manager cackled. "Or I'll take care of you," she looked at Sterno,
"and your little dog, too!" She laughed nastily.
"What a witch!" the Fly commented.
Suddenly, Ernie had a brilliant idea. He grabbed a vase of
flowers off the desk, yanked the flowers out of it, and threw the
water all over the bank manager.
"Eeyah!" she screamed. "I'm all wet!"
The Fly looked at Ernie wonderingly. "Why in the world did you
do that?"
Ernie looked at the bank manager. She was glaring and hissing
at him, water dripping off her face. She was not melting at all.
Ernie became uncomfortably aware of everyone staring at him. "Uh,
well, I thought..." Ernie stuttered.
"You'll have to excuse our friend," Captain Memory ad-libbed
quickly. "It's the stress, you see. Financial problems. He's not
coping..." The three began hustling Ernie towards the door.
The bank manager arose, hissing and spitting. "You haven't
heard the last of this," she shrieked. "You'll see!
The four rushed quickly through the bank and back out onto the
road. The stopped to get their bearings.
"Well, I hope you're satisfied," Sterno said contemptuously to
Ernie. "You've really made a mess of things now!"
"Me!" cried Ernie. "Hey, I'm not the one who left those cigar
butts back in four billion B.C. It's not MY fault..."
"Oh, sure," Sterno interrupted. "Try and blame it on me..."
"Hey, guys!" the Fly broke in. "Look at that!" 
The Fly's huge, multi-faceted eyes had picked up a detail the
others had failed to notice: behind the bank was a small, flat-
roofed brick building. A neon sign proclaimed: Deer Bar. There was
a large picture of a deer beneath it.
"Hey, guys, it's a bar!" the Fly continued. "Whaddya say we
stop in for a drink? Hey, maybe we can meet some girls!"
The others looked at each others confusedly. "Hey, it's okay,
guys!" The Fly went on. "I'll buy!"
Captain Memory looked relieved. "Well, in that case, sure!
Thanks!" They all started towards the bar.
Ernie was finding all of this very confusing. Every time he
thought he was beginning to understand what was going on, events
took a turn in an entirely different direction. Wasn't this
supposed to be the Emerald City? He didn't recall any bars in the
Emerald City! And what about that bank? And what happened to Judy
Garland? They entered the bar. Well, Ernie thought. I'm not sure if
this is a good idea or not, but I could really use a drink.
Ernie found the interior of the bar reassuring. It was cool
and dark. It looked like a typical corner bar, with a typical
corner bartender. In one corner behind the bar a TV set was
mounted, but luckily it was turned off. There were few other
customers in the place, but, of course, business was always kind of
slow in the middle of the day. They seated themselves at the bar.
They bartender, a portly, balding man smoking a cigar, came up
to them. "What'll you have?"
"What kind of beer you got?" The Fly wanted to know.
"Deer."
"Deer?" The Fly was puzzled.
"Deer Beer," the bartender stated matter-of-factly. "This is
the Deer Bar, we got Deer Beer. You want it or not?"
"Uh, yeah, okay," the Fly replied, somewhat confused. "Uh,
three Deer Beers."
Ernie looked at the Fly. It occurred to him that no-one around
here seemed at all disturbed by the Fly's looks. That seemed to a
bit odd. He would have expected the Fly to have attracted somewhat
more attention.But then on the other hand, Ernie thought, it
probably didn't mean anything. After all, everything is pretty
strange around here. Ernie appreciated the opportunity to relax and
have a beer.
The Fly pointed into the darkness at the far end of the bar.
"Hey, get a load of that babe!" he said to Ernie, his antennae
waving excitedly. 
Ernie peered intently. He could just barely see, in the dim
light, a rather disreputable-looking young woman with bleached
blond hair and a skimpy outfit, perched on a stool at the far end
of the bar.
"What's your name, dear?" The Fly called out to her.
"Bambi," she replied.
The Fly was encouraged. "Hey, whaddya say we..."
"Cost you bucks," she interrupted.
The Fly's antennae drooped dispiritedly. "How come there
aren't any nice girls around anymore?" He turned back to his beer.
Sterno looked about worriedly. He sniffed. "Something smells
very peculiar around here."
"Probably just onions." Ernie was unconcerned. 
"Hardly!" sniffed Sterno. "There is something seriously wrong
about this place!"
"NOW who's paranoid?" Ernie dismissed Sterno's fears.
Just then the door to the bar opened, and a woman walked in.
She had flaming red hair, and was wearing a 1950's-style party
dress. "Hi, there, fellas!" she said loudly.
"HI!" The Fly jumped up, his antennae waving excitedly. "Say,
can I buy you a drink?"
"Sure!" she answered in a brassy voice. Ernie looked at the
woman. Not my type, he thought. Too loud. He looked at her again.
Something about her seemed very familiar. Ernie was sure he had
seen her before, but he couldn't quite remember where.
"Gee!" she said to the Fly. "You sure are different-looking!
Where are you from?"
The Fly thought quickly. "Uh..France!"
"Oh, sure, I know France!" the woman answered brightly. "Ooh-
la-la, c'est-la-vie, Eiffel Tower, right?"
"Sure, you got it!" The Fly whispered aside to the others. "Oh
boy, oh boy, I'm really getting somewhere now!" He turned back to
the woman. "So, like, what's your name?"
"Lucy," she answered loudly. The door opened again, and a
swarthy man with slicked-back black hair entered. He was wearing a
Cuban shirt with huge ruffled sleeves, and carrying a pair of
maracas. The woman gestured towards the man. "And this is my
husband, Ricky."
"Aww..." the Fly's antennae drooped.
"How you do!" said the man, with a heavy Spanish accent. "I'm
Ricky Ricardo, de famous Cuban bandleader." He shook his maracas
rhythmically. "Chick-a-boom, chick-a-boom."
"Yeah. Hi." the Fly answered glumly. He turned to the others.
"Wouldn't you know, she's married." He was obviously deeply
disappointed. He brightened a bit. "Say," he said to Lucy. "You
wouldn't happen to have any girlfriends you could ask over, do
you?"
"Friends?" said Lucy shrilly. "Sure, I got friends. In fact,
a couple of them are on there way over right now!"
The Fly was thrilled. "Oh boy, oh boy!" His antennae waved
excitedly. He turned to Ricky. "Hey, I like the shirt, guy! It's
the new `in' thing, right?"
"Chure!" Ricky agreed. "Ees de latest style in Habana!"
The door opened, and in walked an older couple, also dressed
in 1950's styles. "Oh," said Lucy. "Here's my friends now. Fellas,
this is Fred and Ethel Mertz."
"Aww." The Fly was disappointed. These weren't the type of
friends he had been hoping for.
Sterno leaned forward. "There is something terribly wrong with
these people," he said to Ernie and the Captain. "I can smell it."
"Leave me alone," said Ernie. He hadn't forgiven Sterno for
blaming the bank problem on him.
All these people looked terribly familiar to Ernie. Suddenly,
he had it!
"I've got it!" he shouted.
The Fly was more mystified than ever. "Now HE'S got it? What
is it, contagious?" He edged away from Ernie slightly.
"No, not THAT!" said Ernie impatiently. "I just
remembered...it's `I Love Lucy'!"
Lucy put her hand on Ernie's arm. "I love you, too." She said.
She edged closer. "Now that we're friends, I'd like to ask you a
little favor."
"What?" asked Ernie suspiciously. 
"It's just a little thing..." she began hesitantly.
"What?" He edged away uncomfortably.
"We'd just like to borrow it, just for a little while. We'll
bring it right back..."
"What?!" Ernie was getting impatient.
"Um," Lucy seemed a bit embarrassed. "We'd like to borrow your
brain."
"MY BRAIN!" shrieked Ernie.
"We just want to borrow it," said Lucy quickly. "Just for a
little while. We're not going to steal it!" Lucy laughed nervously.
"NO!" Ernie cried.
"Really, you don't have anything to worry about!" Lucy
continued. "We're not going to take it back to our home planet, or
anything! And we're certainly not going to put it into a giant
killer robot and use it to take over the Earth!" She laughed. "We
would never do that!" She turned to Ricky and the Mertz's. "Would
we?"
"Oh, no," they all laughed. "We'd never do that! Never!"
"There, that proves it!" Lucy concluded. "So, how about it?"
She reached towards Ernie's head.
"NO!" Ernie screamed, leaping off the bar stool. "Keep your
hands off my brain!" He whipped out his plastic broadsword and
brandished it menacingly.
After standing there a few moments, Ernie became aware of
everyone looking at him very peculiarly.
"Hey, guy," the Fly inquired. "Like, what are you gonna do
with that plastic sword?"
Ernie could hear the sound of muffled laughter, but he
couldn't tell where it was coming from. Ernie glowered. "Okay,
okay," he said, replacing the sword in it's sheath. "Just keep your
hands off my brain, all right?"
Lucy frowned. She looked at Sterno, and then looked at her
companions. "Dog brain?" she asked them. They all shook their
heads, no. She looked at the Fly. "Fly brain?" she asked Ricky and
the Mertz's. "Nope." They shook their heads. She looked at Captain
Memory. She smiled broadly. "I wonder if I could ask you a
favor..."she began.
"No chance!" Captain Memory cut her off.
Her expression became ugly. Extremely ugly. In fact, thought
Ernie, she was changing into just about the ugliest thing Ernie had
ever seen. Lucy snarled, revealing rows of pointed, reptilian-
looking teeth and a forked tongue.
"Foolish Earth creatures!" she hissed, pulling out a
frightening-looking weapon. "You will turn your brains over to us,
or we will destroy this miserable planet of yours!"
"Who ARE these people?" Ernie whispered to Captain Memory.
"Remember I told you about those aliens?" Captain Memory
asked. Ernie nodded. "Well, here they are!"
"Hey, guys, what do we do now?" the Fly asked Ernie and
Captain Memory, looking at Lucy's weapon uneasily.
Captain Memory looked up brightly. "Hey," he said to Lucy and
her companions. "Wanna watch some TV?"
Lucy and the other aliens were totally confused. "Watch TV? I
don't remember that! Is that in the script? What are we supposed to
do?" They looked at each other confusedly.
"Oh, wow, look what's on!" Before anyone could stop him,
Captain Memory had reached behind the bar and turned on the TV.
"It's time for `Wheel of Torture!'"





CHAPTER 4

An image of Sturmbannfuhrer Dr. Heinz von Liederkranz filled
the screen. "Vis us tonight," he began. "Ve haff our contestants
from our last show." He turned to introduce them. "First, Captain
Memory!" Captain Memory bowed, to polite applause from the
audience. "Goombah de Barbarian!" Ernie blinked and staggered. Once
again, he suddenly found himself on the game show stage. His
stomach flipped over once again. He hated these abrupt changes of
scene. "Not again," he moaned.
Captain Memory shrugged. "Hey, that's show biz!"
The audience was staring at Ernie. They seemed to be expecting
something. He smiled and waved half-heartedly. The audience
tittered and applauded weakly. Ernie noticed that the audience was
still made up entirely of Nazis.
He sighed. He might have known he would wind up back here, he
thought. Whatever the worst thing is that could possibly happen,
that's what will happen. Ernie frowned. In fact, this was even the
worst thing that couldn't possibly happen, and it was happening
anyway! Wasn't that against Murphy's Law, or something? Anyway, it
was all very confusing.
Von Liederkranz turned to the other side of the stage. Ernie
noticed that the aliens had been transported onto the game show as
well, and were now staggering and blinking, just like Ernie.
 "Und tonight, ve have vith us special guests," von Liederkranz
said, gesturing towards the aliens with his riding crop. "Lucy and
Ricky Ricardo, the famous Cuban bandleader, and their friends, Fred
and Ethel Mertz." Thunderous applause greeted the introduction.
The aliens were utterly confused. "Chick-a-boom?" asked Ricky,
shaking his maracas feebly. The Mertz's drew alien weapons,
pointing them in all directions uncertainly.
"Und now, ze big question," von Liederkranz said to the
aliens. "Vill you take vot's in dis bag," he held up a small paper
bag, which looked a lot like somebody's lunch. "Or try for vot's
behind door number four!"
The audience was hushed with anticipation. The aliens looked
at each other in confusion. "What do we do? I wasn't prepared for
this! I don't know what to do!" they told each other.
Captain Memory decided to help them out. "Anyone with any
BRAINS would take what's behind door number four!" he hinted.
The aliens brightened. "Brains! Brains! Yes, that's it! Let's
take what's behind door number four!" They looked pleased. "Chick-
a-BOOM!" said Ricky definitely.
"Door number four it is!" called out von Liederkranz. The
audience roared it's approval.
An attractive woman in a chorus-girl outfit opened door number
four, and the aliens filed in, looking very pleased. As soon as the
last alien was inside, the door slammed with a metallic crash. The
chorus girl reached over and daintily locked it.
Immediately, Ernie began to hear the sounds of commotion
coming from behind the door. At first, pounding, then thuds, then
shrill, blood-curdling screams. The screams continued for several
minutes, and then died away. Finally, all was silent behind door
number four.
The audience applauded. "Vell," von Liederkranz announced
jovially. "Looks like dey got vot dey had coming to dem, doesn't
it?" He laughed. He turned to Ernie, Captain Memory, and the
others. Ernie noticed that, while their attention had been drawn
elsewhere, guards with machine guns had surrounded them. "Shtill,
it vas very considerate of dem to find you for me," he said, with
an evil gleam in his eye. "I vas afraid ve had lost you forever
after dat unfortunate incident vit de alien Blaster." Von
Liederkranz turned to the guard nearest him. "...for vhich YOU vill
pay, schweinhund!" He lashed the guard with his riding crop.
"But, Herr Doktor," the guard protested. "I vasn't even
there!"
"Shut up!" von Liederkranz snapped. He turned to Captain
Memory. "Und now, perhaps ve vill continue vith ze questions, ja?"
He smiled sadistically. "You remember vhere ve left off? Vis ze Hot
Vhirling Corkscrew?" 
A guard handed von Liederkranz the by-now-familiar diabolical-
looking device, which began to glow and whirl. Von Liederkranz
smiled evilly. He began slowly advancing toward Captain Memory with
his device.
Von Liederkranz was disturbed by the sound of a knock. He
looked around. There it was again; someone was knocking on the
stage door. Von Liederkranz was annoyed. "Answer ze door,
dummkopf!" he snapped at one of the guards. The guard opened the
door.
"Mailman!" A fellow in a post office uniform walked in the
door. "Got a special delivery letter here!"
Von Liederkranz narrowed his eyes suspiciously. "For who?"
"Is there a `Mr. Ernest Ross' here?" 
"Uh, that's me," Ernie said.
"Here you go!" The mailman handed Ernie a letter.
Everything stopped while Ernie opened the letter. Von
Liederkranz and the Nazis milled about confusedly.
Ernie was totally mystified. Who could be sending him a
letter, here? Nobody knew he was here, and even if they did, why
would they send him a letter here? Ernie tore the letter open and
read.

"Dear Mr. Ross,
We still have not received payment on your outstanding
balance of$195,412,771,213,312,032.29. This account is now two
billion years overdue. Do not force us to turn this matter over to
a collection agency. Send in your payment immediately, before we
are required to take further action.

Sincerely,

First National Bank of the West

P.S. If you have already sent in your payment, please disregard
this notice."
Ernie looked up. Von Liederkranz was watching him very
carefully. Ernie had an idea. "Oops, looks like I gotta go pay a
bill! See ya!" Ernie started towards the door.
"Not so fast!" Von Liederkranz blocked Ernie's path. "Give me
dot letter!" He snatched it out of Ernie's hand.
Der Sturmbannfuhrer was very upset. How dare they interrupt
his game show to deliver a letter! And just exactly who was this
message from, anyway? And what did it really mean?
Von Liederkranz examined the letter carefully. "Zo," he said
thoughtfully. "You owe ze bank one hundred and ninety-five
quadrillion dollars. Just as we thought!" Of course, it wasn't
really what he thought at all.
The Nazi's eyes narrowed. "Zis one hundred and ninety-five
quadrillion dollars, it is a great deal of money, ja?"
"Ja. I mean, yes," agreed Ernie.
"It is more, even, than I make in a veek!" Von Liederkranz
eyed Ernie suspiciously. "Zo, how is it dot you come to owe zo much
money?"
"Well, you see, there was this problem with cigar butts two
billion years ago," Ernie explained nervously. He didn't like the
Nazi's tone of voice, and he particularly didn't like the Hot
Whirling Corkscrew. "And then, we were at the bank, and I had to go
and open my big mouth, and so then..."
"SCHWEINHUND!" Von Liederkranz whipped Ernie with the letter.
"Do you take me for a fool!? No-one could possibly owe zis much
money! Obviously, zis is some sort of secret code. Now, who vould
be sending you secret coded messages HERE, on mein own game show!?"
Ernie looked pleadingly at Captain Memory; the Captain just
shrugged.
Von Liederkranz continued reflectively. "Und how could zey
know vhere to find you vis zis message, unless..." He whirled to
face his guards. "One of YOU is a traitor!!"
"Nein! Nein!" The guards blanched and backed away. Von
Liederkranz looked at the audience. "Or perhaps, one of YOU!"
"NEIN! NEIN!" the audience cried out in unison, fidgeting
uncomfortably in their seats.
Von Liederkranz advanced on the audience, the Hot Whirling
Corkscrew spinning and glowing in his hand. "Zo, you vill not
confess, eh!?" he shrieked at the audience. "Perhaps a taste of the
Corkscrew vill loosen your tongues!"
Ernie felt a tap on his shoulder. Captain Memory beckoned
towards the back of the stage. All eyes were riveted on von
Liederkranz, and on the hissing, spinning torture device in his
hand. No-one was paying any attention to the foursome. They tiptoed
into the wings and back behind the stage. As they left, they began
to hear screams coming from somewhere in the audience.
They hurried along the corridor leading to the dressing rooms
backstage. Unfortunately, there seemed to be no exits anywhere in
that part of the building. The only exits were through the main
floor, which would have required them to go back out onto the
stage. This did not seem like a very good idea. An empty dressing
room beckoned ahead of them. They hurried into it and locked the
door behind them. The screams were still audible inside the room.
"Hey, guys," the Fly wanted to know. "Like, what are we gonna
do now?"
Ernie sneezed. "I wish they wouldn't keep the air conditioning
turned up so high," he complained, shivering.
"Well, if you're going to go around wearingnothing but that
ridiculous fur loincloth, you have to expect to get a chill,"
commented Sterno unsympathetically. " We'd all feel a lot better if
you'd cover up some of that pallid skin of yours."
"Hey, that's an idea!" the Fly chimed in. "This is a dressing
room! Maybe there's some clothes here you can wear!"
That seemed like a good idea to Ernie. He'd been uncomfortably
cold ever since he'd put that silly loincloth on. He began looking
through the closet, but found only filmy negligees and harem-girl
outfits.
"Hey, there's a whole wardrobe room next door," the Fly
pointed to an adjoining room. "Take a look in there!" Ernie
disappeared into the next room.
Sterno was searching the room carefully. "What'cha looking
for, secret passages?" the Fly asked eagerly.
"Actually, I was rather hoping someone might have left a spot
of brandy about," he answered. "Aha!" He pulled out a bottle. A
look of disappointment appeared on his face. "MD 20/20?" he asked.
"What in the world could that be?"
"Oh, wow," commented the Fly. "Mad Dog!"
"I beg your pardon!" snapped Sterno huffily.
"Hey, no offense!" said the Fly quickly. "That's just what
it's called, you know?"
"Hmmph!" Sterno opened the bottle and sniffed the contents.
"Dreadful!" he proclaimed, and dropped the bottle in the trash.
Ernie reappeared from the wardrobe room. He was now clad in a
Spanish toreador outfit, consisting of a scintillating gold suit,
covered with sequins, with knee breeches and white stockings, a
white shirt and tie, and an odd-shaped little black hat.
He noticed everyone looking at him oddly. "Hey, it was the
only thing I could find, you know? Ernie said defensively. "At
least it's warm!"
Sterno sniffed. "I must say, you have the most AWFUL taste in
clothes! But, at least it's better than looking at that sickening
body of yours!"
Ernie was offended. "What's wrong with my body?"
Sterno rolled his eyes upward silently.
Only the Fly seemed to approve of Ernie's new outfit. "Hey,
guy," he said enthusiastically. "I like the suit! It's the new `in'
thing, right?"
Sterno regarded Ernie critically. "Why are you still carrying
that ridiculous plastic broadsword?"
Ernie shifted uncomfortably. "Hey, I told you, it's a forty
buck deposit!"
Sterno rolled his eyes upward. "Hopeless!"
Ernie sat down in a comfortable-looking chair. He thought he
had better take advantage of every opportunity to rest; he had no
way of knowing how long all of this craziness was going to
continue.
"So, like, what's with that Lucy chick?" the Fly asked Captain
Memory. "I mean, like, what's her problem?"
"Oh, she's an alien," explained the Captain.
"A what?"
"You know," the Captain went on. "Come from outer space,
invade the Earth, steal your brain, that kinda stuff." The Captain
made himself comfortable on a small sofa, and began leafing through
his copy of the TV Guide.
"Aliens?" Ernie asked confusedly. "Are they really aliens?"
"There as real as anything in Cyberspace, I suppose," the
Captain commented.
"But what are they DOING here?" Ernie wanted to know.
"They're part of a game called `MENACE FROM PLANET ZERO'. It's
quite popular," the Captain explained. "I figured we'd run across
it sooner or later. With all the systems Waldo's been taking over,
the odds are that it'd be in at least one of them."
The Fly seemed a bit skeptical. "Well, gee, that chick sure
didn't look like an alien!"
The Captain was impatient. "She's in disguise, of course! You
wouldn't want to see what she really looks like!" He shuddered.
"Anyway," he continued. "That whole bunch are aliens in disguise.
They've been watching our 1950's TV shows, and they think those TV
characters are normal Earth people. They think if they disguise
themselves as 1950's TV characters, you Earth people will never
know the difference."
"They don't seem to be very smart," Ernie commented.
"Well, you know," said the Captain thoughtfully. "Intelligence
is not the only way to approach reality. There are other ways of
thinking. It's possible to approach problem-solving from an
entirely different perspective. There are civilizations in which
thinking is done in an entirely different way, where `intelligence'
is replaced by a whole different way of looking at the universe!"
Ernie had never heard Captain Memory get so philosophical
before. "So, do these aliens have a completely different way of
thinking?" he asked wonderingly.
"No," said the Captain reflectively. "They're just stupid."
He returned to his TV Guide.
"I mighta known," said the Fly reflectively. "After all, she's
hanging out with that Ricky guy! Man, he's something else! Anybody
who'd wear a shirt like that..." He trailed off, looking sideways
at Ernie.
A number of magazines were scattered about an end table next
to Ernie's chair. A headline in one of the caught Ernie's eye:
"FANTASTIC ARCHAEOLOGICAL FIND REVEALED!" Ernie picked it up and
began to read:
"On October 16, 1978, an Arab shepherd following a stray
animal into a cave near the Sea of Galilee made an incredible find
- a find unparalleled in modern history. A find so monumental, so
earth-shattering, so threatening to world governments and religious
institutions that its very existence has been suppressed. Only now,
by means of smuggled documents obtained at great personal risk to
all involved, can this fabulous story come to light- the story of
the Dead Sea Phonograph Records!"
Ernie was intrigued. He read on:
"Our story must really begin in Ancient Egypt - deep in the
mysteries of the Middle Kingdom; an age which produced some of the
greatest wonders the world has even seen. Some of these, like the
Pyramids, have been known to the world for millennia. Yet it stands
to reason that any people capable of producing wonders like these,
wonders which the modern world has yet to equal, must also have
been capable of producing many other amazing things on a smaller
scale. Yet, all of these have been lost in the sands of time - or
have they?
Let us consider for a moment the phonograph - a relatively
simple device invented in the last century by Thomas Edison. In its
basic form it consists of a disc, or even a cylinder, driven by a
crank, that comes in contact with a needle attached to a cone. One
can then either play or record simply by turning the crank and
either speaking into the cone, or listening. That's all there is to
it. A simple device like this can be made with almost anyone with
basic tools. It could have been made thousands of years ago - it
could even have been made by the ancient Egyptians! Certainly, any
civilization capable of producing incredible engineering feats like
the Pyramids would be capable of constructing a simple mechanical
device like this!
Now there is evidence that they did! In the tomb of the
Pharaoh Pepto II at Bismol, hieroglyphics have been found which
bear an uncanny resemblance to Edison's early phonographs. Along
with these were others which were translated to read "...and the
voice of the Pharaoh shall speak on after he is gone
and...(fragment missing)...that we, who are as dogs to the mighty
Pharaoh, shall listen to Our Master's Voice!"
Ernie looked at the accompanying illustration. It was a
picture from an Egyptian tomb, showing a dog listening to some kind
of a device with a cone coming out of it. It reminded Ernie of
something. Didn't it look a lot like...the RCA Victor logo? Then
again, maybe not. He continued reading.
"But this is only the beginning! It would be monumental enough
if records of the voices of the Pharaohs had been found, but what
has actually been discovered is so spectacular as to make the
Pharaohs seem trivial by comparison. It was, of course, phonograph
records that the Arab shepherd found. They were in the form of
discs made of fine clay, a material much more durable than the
perishable vinyl that our present-day phonograph records are made
of, and were packed in the crumbling remains of an Egyptian-style
case. When played at approximately 78 rpm, they produced voices,
much like our own early phonograph records.
But - stop and consider. These records were found deep in
Israel, near the Sea of Galilee - in other words, nowhere near the
Egypt of the Pharaohs. There is no evidence that the phonograph was
ever used in ancient Israel; what's more, they were in an Egyptian-
style case, and bore Egyptian markings. How could they have come to
a cave near the Sea of Galilee?
There is only one way: They must have been brought there, from
Egypt - by the fleeing Israelites! Hieroglyphics prove that the
phonograph was in existence at this time; what would have been more
reasonable than for the fleeing Israelites, taking with them the
treasures of Egypt, to take with them this great treasure?
But what would they have used it for? What else but for the
same use as the Pharaohs, to record and preserve the voice of their
leader, so that his will can be known forever - the voice of Moses!
Yet, if this device, the phonograph, was in the hands of
Moses, wouldn't he have used it to record the things he considered
of greatest importance? In that case, wouldn't he have taken it to
Mount Sinai? Wouldn't he have used it to record - the voice of God
Himself?
Now you can see why this find has been suppressed - why no
government, no religious institution on Earth can afford to let
these records be heard. They contain at the very least the voice of
Moses, and possibly even the very voice of God. There may be things
on these records which could change the life of every man, woman,
and child on Earth - now, today, in the 20th century.
But will these records ever be heard? Or will they be hidden
away in a secret vault, kept from a world that needs them so
desperately?
They must be heard! The people have a right to this knowledge,
knowledge which affects each and every one of them in every facet
of their daily lives. Right now there is no way of knowing where
they are being held, or by whom, or for what purpose. But a find
like this CANNOT be suppressed. It is to earth-shaking, too
monumental. Word WILL leak out, people WILL be told! Already this
has begun to happen - secret documents have been smuggled out;
incontrovertible evidence has been uncovered. It is beginning - now
it is only a mater of time before the world learns the awesome
truth about the Dead Sea Phonograph Records!"


Ernie put the magazine down. Wow, he thought. This is really
heavy. Is this for real, or is this just more crazy nonsense? Did
this really happen, or is this just more garbage caused by sticking
together too many computer programs that don't belong together? How
can we tell the difference?
Ernie thought about the problem. This is an important
question, he decided. We may have stumbled onto something really
meaningful. Somebody ought to look into this. Somebody ought to
find out whether this is for real or not, because if it is real it
might be...really important! Ernie stopped. He hadn't the vaguest
idea how somebody would go about looking into a question like this.
Ernie looked at Captain Memory. "Here, look at this article."
He handed the magazine to the Captain.
The Captain peered at the article. "The Dead Sea Phonograph
Records? Get real!" Captain Memory tossed the magazine over his
shoulder.
"No, really!" Ernie protested. "This is important stuff! I
really think you should consider it! What if this really happened?
What if this is, like a secret CIA computer file or something? I
mean, stuff like that could be here, right? It's possible, isn't
it?"
"Aything's possible," the Captain admitted. "But how likely is
it?"
Ernie heard snickering coming from behind him. He turned.
Sterno had picked up the magazine, and was leafing through it.
"You actually READ this stuff?" laughed Sterno. "Here's a good
article: `Princess Diana says, I'm Carrying Elvis's Baby'. Or, how
about `I Was Raped by Killer Lesbians from Outer Space'".
Ernie frowned. Something about that last headline sounded a
little familiar.
Sterno continued. "Here another one: `Earth invaded by Aliens
Disguised as 1950's TV Characters'."
"Hey, lemme see that!" Ernie reached for the magazine,
convinced that they were onto something.
"What trash!" Sterno dropped the magazine in the wastebasket.
"Hey!" Ernie fished through the wastebasket, trying to
retrieve the magazine. "Oh no, it's all covered with sticky wine!
The pages are all stuck together!"
"Wow, man," said the Fly wonderingly. "That's really heavy
stuff. Imagine that: Princess Diana pregnant with Elvis's baby. I
never knew that!"
Ernie was trying to separate the pages of the magazine, but
the Mad Dog wine had dissolved most of the ink, and he was only
succeeding in making a big mess. 
"Did you really think you were going to find the secrets of
the universe in that magazine?" asked Sterno sarcastically.
"I don't think you're going to get anywhere with that stuff,"
added Captain Memory. "I think you're barking up the wrong tree!"
"I suppose you think that's funny!" Sterno snarled. 
 He regarded Ernie for a moment. "You know, that little hat looks
really ridiculous!"
"Yeah, guy," the Fly chimed in. "How come you're wearing that
Mickey Mouse hat?"
"It's not a Mickey Mouse hat, alright?" said Ernie,
frustrated. "It's part of the outfit. You're supposed to wear this
kind of a little hat. I dunno why, you're just supposed to!" Ernie
sulked. "Leave me alone!"
Sterno chuckled. "The only good thing about having him along,"
he said, gesturing at Ernie. "Is that he can always cheer me up. If
I didn't have him to laugh at, I don't know WHAT I'd do!" Ernie
glowered.
The Fly was sitting at a dressing table, regarding himself in
the mirror. He kept examining various bottle of cosmetics, holding
each in turn up to his face, but he couldn't find any that matched
his shell tone.
"My, what big eyes you have!" quipped Sterno. "How about some
eyeliner? Or maybe some mascara for your antenna?"
"Aw, c'mon guys," the Fly complained. "Gimme a break, huh? I
was just looking for a little, like, bronzer, y'know? Y'think
bronzer would look good on me?" His antennae waved hopefully.
Ernie was feeling irritable. He was tired of everyone picking
on him all the time. "Why do you keep reading that TV Guide?" he
snapped at Captain Memory.
"So I can see what's on," answered the Captain reasonably.
"How can you possibly tell what's on, when you don't even know
where we are? You're never gonna have the right listings for here,
wherever THIS is!"
"Sure I do," disagreed the Captain. "I've got the listings for
everywhere."
"How could you have that?" Ernie was skeptical.
"This is the Inter-Continuum Edition, with Multi-Galactic Sub-
Listings, for the week of May 3-Infinity," explained the Captain.
"It's got the listings for all of Time and Space."
"Lemme see that!" Ernie snatched it rudely out of Captain
Memory's hand. "Why, the pages are all blank!"
"Are you a subscriber?" the Captain wanted to know, gently
taking the book back out of Ernie's hands.
"Well, no," Ernie admitted.
"Well, that's why you can't see it!" 
Ernie sighed. He guessed that made as much sense as anything
else.
CM examined the listings carefully. "Wanna watch an old movie?
Here's a classic: `Mr. Blandings Builds his Dream Horse'."
Ernie frowned. "You mean `House'."
Captain Memory was puzzled. "Mr. House Builds his Dream
Horse'?"
Ernie shook his head. "No, no. It's supposed to be `Mr.
Blandings Builds his Dream House'."
Captain Memory peered at the TV Guide. "It quite clearly says
here `Horse'."
"That's ridiculous!" Ernie insisted. "You can't build a
horse!"
"That's right!" the Fly chimed in. "At least, not without a
permit!"
"Huh?" Ernie was taken aback.
"And an inspection!" the Fly went on. "I mean, you wouldn't
want to ride a horse that was built without a permit, and wasn't
inspected! It wouldn't be safe!"
"Uh..." Something about this didn't sound right to Ernie.
The Fly continued with enthusiasm. "I mean, like what if you
took this horse out on the freeway, you know, and you're cruisin'
along, doin' maybe 60, and all of a sudden - boom! A leg falls off!
Then what? Somebody could get hurt!"
Ernie didn't know how to argue with this. "Uh, I suppose
you're right." He fell silent.
Captain Memory broke the silence. "Hey, here's a good show!
8:30 - `Follow the Yellow Brick Road'. The Fab Four stop for a
drink at The Deer Bar, and meet aliens disguised as 1950's TV
characters.' Starring Lucille Ball, Adam West, and Rin-Tin-Tin. How
about that?"
"Sounds okay to me," said the Fly agreeably.
Ernie looked around the room. "There's no TV!" he said
triumphantly.
"Oh, there's always a TV!" the Captain assured him.
"Okay, where?" Ernie demanded.
"Hmm." Captain Memory looked around. He got up, walked over to
the dressing table, and peered into the mirror. "Let's try this: 
`Mirror, mirror, on the wall,
Ain't there no TV at all?'"
The surface of the mirror dissolved, and an image of The Deer
Bar appeared in its place. Four characters were seated at the bar,
drinking beer.
"So, what are we gonna do now, guys?" asked the Fly, sipping
a beer through his long, flexible snout.
Ernie started, and looked about confusedly. They were suddenly
all back at The Deer Bar. His stomach flipped over again.
"What...uh..how did we get back here?"
"Same way we got out," said Captain Memory, gesturing towards
the TV set. He looked momentarily confused. "Either that, or maybe
we never really left at all. I forget which. Oh well, it doesn't
really matter."
Ernie looked up at the television above the bar, which now was
turned on. A sadistic Nazi talk show host was using a diabolical-
looking device to torture members of the audience. "Uh, do you mind
if I turn that off?" asked Ernie.
"If you like," answered the Captain indifferently.
Ernie switched off the set, and breathed a sigh of relief. Now
they were safe. He frowned. Well, maybe they weren't safe, but they
were safER. He thought about it a moment. Well, maybe they weren't
really any safer, but turning the TV off made him feel better just
the same. That satisfied him, so he returned to his seat.
The Fly looked around. "Like, we're the only ones here!"
"Uh huh," Ernie agreed.
"So, what happened to, like, Ricky and Lucy?"
As if in answer, the door to the bar flew open, and in
staggered Ricky, his ruffled Cuban shirt in rags, his maracas
broken. Close behind him was Lucy, her hair disarrayed, her party
dress torn and smeared with dirt.
"You feelthy peeg!" shrieked Ricky, enraged. "You send us
behind door numero four! I keel you!"
"What did he say?" the Fly asked confusedly. "I can't
understand his accent at all!"
"I think he said he was going to `keel' us," Sterno
volunteered.
"What's that?" the Fly wanted to know. "Something to do with
boats?"
Ricky advanced on the foursome, holding his shattered maracas
menacingly. Ernie noticed that they seemed to have acquired very
sharp edges. "I keel you, I cut your brain out!" he threatened
Ernie.
"Hey, he's starting up with that `brain' stuff again," Ernie
said to Captain Memory. "What do we do?"
"Have a beer," said Captain Memory, sipping his Deer Beer.
"That's easy for you to say! It's not your brain he's after!"
Ernie looked at Ricky apprehensively.
"Why don't you just let him have your brain?" snickered
Sterno. "You'll never miss it!"
Ricky slowly staggered forward. Ernie noticed that Ricky was
getting much more, sort of, reptilian-looking. He seemed to have
acquired long, sharp teeth, and a forked tongue, which flitted in
and out of his mouth in a snake-like manner.
"Hey uh, shouldn't we, uh, DO something?" Ernie urged Captain
Memory.
The Captain looked annoyed. "Oh, all right!" He cleared his
throat. "And now," he announced pompously. "A word from our
sponsor!"
Ricky froze. "Oh, ees a commercial," he said to Lucy. "We got
to wait!"
"Well, I guess we'd better get going, fellas," Captain Memory
said to the other three. "We've only got sixty seconds." He gulped
down the rest of his beer. "I hate to drink beer in a hurry. It
upsets my stomach." He burped. He brushed past Ricky and Lucy, who
were frozen into a state of immobility, and led the group out the
door.
Once outside, Captain Memory checked his bare wrist. "Hmm,
ten more seconds. I know, let's try this!" The Captain led the
group around the side of the building, where they could not be seen
from the main door.
Fifteen seconds later, Ricky and Lucy burst out of the bar
door. "Where dey go?!" Ricky screamed. "Dey not suppose' to move
during de commercial! Dey got to wait for de show to start again!"
Ricky and Lucy looked quickly around, and then charged off down the
road in the direction of the bank.
The Fly peeked around the corner. "Looks like they're gone."
Ernie frowned. "Are these aliens really that stupid?" he asked
the Captain.
"I'm afraid so," Captain Memory replied.
Ernie frowned. Something about this didn't seem to make sense.
"If they're so stupid, how come they've got interstellar travel,
and blasters, and stuff like that?" he asked pointedly.
"Well, you know, aliens have brother-in-laws, too," Captain
Memory explained.
"Brothers-in-law," Sterno corrected.
"Uh, right," the Captain went on. "Uh, relatives. They have
relatives too. Everybody has relatives."
"So?" Ernie wanted to know.
Captain Memory sighed. "Well, what do you do if your brother-
in-law needs a job, but he's not too, um, bright? I mean, you can't
leave him to starve, right? After all, he's married to your sister.
Okay, so maybe your sister doesn't have real good taste in men,
she's still your sister, right? And what about your nephews..."
"Get to the point!" Sterno demanded impatiently.
"Okay, okay," Captain Memory went on. "Anyway, you've got to
get him a job, but you don't want to get him anything too, like,
visible, because you know he's going to screw it up, and you'll get
blamed. So you get him a job that pays good, but is, um, out of the
way. Like, for instance, `interstellar scout.' Sure, he'll screw it
up, but he's millions of light years away, who's gonna know?"
Ernie looked crestfallen. "I always thought they'd send, you
know, their `Top Guns', their `best and brightest' to attack us.
You're mean they send their screw-ups to invade our planet?"
Captain Memory shrugged. "Well, you know, it's a bureaucracy.
This is the real universe. Life's like that." Ernie sighed.
Captain Memory looked at his bare wrist. "Anyway, I think it's
time to get going." He headed off purposefully down the yellow
brick road, going in the opposite direction from that in which
Ricky and Lucy had gone. The group trailed along behind him.


CHAPTER 5


Ernie caught up to Captain Memory as the foursome headed down
the yellow brick road. "So, where are we anyway?" he wanted to
know.
The Captain looked around. "Could be Kansas, I suppose," he
said thoughtfully.
"You don't KNOW?"
Captain Memory shrugged. "You can't expect me to keep track of
all these PLACES," he said annoyedly. "Do you know how many PLACES
there are in Cyberspace? There's...there's..." He hesitated
confusedly. "Well, I don't know exactly how many, but there's a
whole lot of them!And they keep changing all the time, too! I
mean, you can go someplace you know real well, you come back in a
few nanoseconds, and it's all different! It was bad enough before
Waldo Stadium starting networking all these systems that were never
meant to be networked. Now it's impossible!So don't expect ME to
keep track of it! It isn't MY fault!" He calmed down. "Anyway," he
said, more composedly. "I guess it could be Nebraska."
Ernie peered into the distance. "What's all that smoke?" He
pointed to a large cloud on the horizon.
The Fly looked searchingly into the distance. With his huge,
multi-faceted insect eyes, he could see more clearly than any
human. "That's not smoke, that's dust," he explained. "There's a
whole lot of trucks and cars and stuff heading this way. There's
enough to be an army of 'em." He peered into the distance. "In
fact, it IS an army! They got tanks, and guns, and everything!"
Ernie felt uneasy. "So, whose army it is?"
They Fly squinted. "I can't tell; too much dust."
"Maybe we should just get out of the way and let them go by,"
Sterno suggested.
This seemed like an excellent idea to Ernie. They stepped off
the road, climbed over a picturesque split-rail fence, and made
their way into a cornfield, where they hid themselves among the
tall plants. Ernie noticed a scarecrow out in the middle of the
field. He thought about it for a moment, but then he decided to
just leave it alone.
In a few minutes the first vehicles of the military column
began to pass them. Ernie noticed that they were armored personnel
carriers, painted tan and grey. On the side of each was the
insignia of a palm tree with a swastika at the base. Ernie
recognized it from watching war movies on the late show. "It's the
Afrika Korps!" he whispered to Captain Memory. "What would they be
doing in Kansas, or maybe Nebraska?"
"Aha," said Captain Memory quietly. "So that's it - Rommel
must be advancing on Omaha! Therefore, it will be up to Prince
Eugene to stop the Turkish hordes at the gates of Vienna. In that
case, Colonel Jackson must be heading down the mighty Mississippi
at this very moment, taking a little bacon and a little beans, to
fight the bloody British at the town of New Orleans! That means,"
Captain Memory looked at his wrist. "It must be 1814!"
"Oh." Ernie no longer expected Captain Memory's explanations
to shed much light on things, although, thinking about it,
something about the last part of Captain Memory's explanation did
sound a little familiar. But then, on the other hand, everything
sounded a little familiar, but none of it actually made any sense.
Ernie decided to try again, even though he didn't have much
hope of success. "So what's going on, anyway? Isn't this supposed
to be, like, the Wizard of Oz or something? I don't remember any
Nazi armies in the Wizard of Oz!"
"The Wizard of Oz?" the Captain asked wonderingly. "Whatever
gave you that idea?"
"Well, gee.." Ernie had thought it was obvious. "There's this
yellow brick road, and the bank manager was kind of a witch, and
she had ruby slippers and..." He trailed off.
"So what?" the Captain demanded.
"Well...If this isn't the Wizard of Oz, where did all that
stuff come from?"
The Captain was annoyed. "Sure, some of this is from THE
WIZARD OF OZ. But some of it isn't. Some of it's from other games,
or computer models, or databases, or whatever happened to be in the
systems that Waldo's been taking over. And there's no way to tell
what'll pop out where, or when. Even Waldo can't keep track of it.
It's taking all his computing power just to keep the system halfway
organized, so it doesn't crash. You know how hard it is to keep a
FATAL ERROR from creeping into this stuff? It's only because he's
got a multiple-redundant neural-net system that he can keep this
stuff running at all!"
Ernie moaned. He didn't like the sound of that FATAL ERROR
business.
"One thing bothers me, though," the Captain continued,
watching the military vehicles go by. "These Nazis. They're showing
up way too often. They may be somehow picking up our trail."
"You mean Waldo Stadium knows where we are?" Ernie cried
anxiously. "He's zeroing in on us?"
"Could be," said the Captain thoughtfully. "It doesn't seem
like they know exactly where we are, but it does seem like they
know we're around here somewhere. I wonder how they know that?"
Ernie sighed again. He would have to remember not to ask for
explanations anymore. They just made things worse.
After a few minutes, the last of the military vehicles passed,
taking with it the last of the huge cloud of dust. Ernie coughed.
He and the others were all covered with a thick layer of dirt. He
looked at himself. All the sparkle was gone from his toreador suit.
Sterno shook himself vigorously, sending dust flying in all
directions. "Hey, watch it!" the Fly complained. "That stuff gets
in my eyes, you know?"
Ernie looked at Captain Memory. "How come you're not covered
with dirt?" he demanded.
"Oh, it's the suit," Captain Memory explained, fingering his
comic-book-character outfit. "It's got that dirt-repelling stuff;
you know, the kind you put in the dryer?"
Ernie examined his toreador outfit. On the inside he found a
small tag. Just my luck, Ernie thought. `Dry Clean Only'.
They made their way back on to the road, and continued in the
same direction they had been heading before the convoy went by. A
light breeze sprang up, and carried away the worst of the dust.
After walking for a few minutes, Ernie noticed a house in the
distance. As they approached, Ernie could see that it was an
elaborate Victorian cottage, covered with gingerbread-style
ornamentation. "Hey, let's stop in!" the Fly suggested. "Maybe we
can get a drink of water. All this dust is really buggin' me!"
"Oh, it's `bugging' you?" asked Sterno maliciously.
"Yeah!" the Fly answered ingenuously.
Sterno shrugged. There was no point in sniping at people who
were too dense to understand it.
As they neared the cottage, Ernie noticed that it was
surrounded by a white picket fence. However, a large section of the
fence had been knocked over. The lawn seemed to be all chewed up,
as though by the treads of a tank. Heading up the front walk, Ernie
noticed the door was broken off it's hinges. 
As they climbed the porch, Ernie noticed that the gingerbread
on the cottage was - actual gingerbread, the edible kind. Ernie
broke off a piece and sniffed it. It seemed fresh. He took a bite.
Very tasty, he thought. He suddenly realized that he hadn't had
anything to eat for a really long time. The shutters looked
interesting - they had frosting and raisins.
"Oh wow, what happened here?" Ernie heard the Fly ask. He
looked through the door. Inside were obvious signs of a struggle.
The quaint, German-style furniture was scattered about. The walls
were pockmarked with bullet holes. On one side of the room was a
large, cast-iron stove. Next to the stove stood a large cage, with
its door open. The stove was red-hot, and a bad smell came from it.
Captain Memory considered the scene, and regarded the tank
tracks and bullet holes. "Looks like whoever was here got arrested
by the Nazis," he commented.
Ernie thought about this. Hansel and Gretel arrested by the
Nazis? But then again, `Hansel and Gretel' is a German story, isn't
it? In that case, Ernie decided, it's none of my business. I won't
worry about it. Instead, he decided to look for something else to
eat.
Ernie found an old-fashioned icebox, which seemed to be full
of pies, cakes, and other goodies. There didn't seem to be anything
by way of regular, wholesome food, though. Oh well, thought Ernie,
cutting into a Bavarian Black Forest Torte, I guess I'll just have
to rough it.
Sterno was helping himself to an eclair. "Very nice," he
commented. "Would you mind handing me a piece of that double-
chocolate rum cheesecake?"
"Hey, this is good stuff!" the Fly added, vacuuming up a dish
of frosted ginger snaps through his long snout.
Ernie stopped. "Hey, how do we know this stuff is okay? I
mean, maybe this is an alien trap, or something. Maybe this stuff
is poisoned!"
Sterno sniffed disgustedly. "We can always count on you to say
something utterly inappropriate at the table, can't we? Comments
like that can ruin everyone's appetite. The first decent thing
we've had to eat on this entire ridiculous escapade, and you have
to go and spoil it!"
Ernie was upset. "Well, okay, maybe you're right. That's not
dinner-table conversation. But still, how do we know?"
Sterno sighed. "The problem with you is that you have no sense
of smell. I, for one, would have known if there was anything wrong
with these delectable little morsels."
Ernie relaxed. "So, this place isn't an alien trap, or
anything?" he asked Captain Memory.
"Oh no, it's a trap alright," the Captain said unconcernedly,
helping himself to a dish of something with custard and cherries in
it.
"WHAT?!"
"But the food's okay," the Captain continued. "So we might as
well have some, don't you think?" He helped himself to a coconut
cream pie.
Ernie suddenly felt very anxious. "So, uh, where's the trap,
then?"
"Oh, I don't know," the Captain went on. "We'll find it,
though. We always do." He looked at Ernie's plate. "Say, are you
gonna eat that Black Forest Torte? If you don't want it, I'll take
it!"
Ernie seemed to have lost his appetite. "Uh, here. Take it."
He handed the dish to Captain Memory. Ernie's stomach was beginning
to feel queasy again. Stress, he thought. It's not good for me. I'm
gonna get an ulcer. I just know it.
Ernie noticed an open door in the back of the cottage. It
seemed to lead to a bathroom. Maybe I can get cleaned up, Ernie
thought. The dust was beginning to make him itch.
Inside the door, Ernie found a nicely-appointed modern
bathroom, complete with soap and fresh towels. I'll bet I have time
for a quick shower, he thought. He turned on the shower and let the
water run for a bit. Nice and warm, he thought. Not too hot. Seems
okay. He took off his toreador suit, shaking the dust off each
piece in turn, and got in the shower.
Ernie let the warn water run over him. Well, this is much
better, he thought, relaxing. There was a bottle of shampoo on the
tub shelf. He picked it up and examined it. "Placental Protein
Shampoo". Oh. That was the same kind of shampoo he used at home.
Maybe it would get the dust out of his hair. 
"Watch ouph phrm trmp..." What? Was somebody talking to him?
Ernie couldn't hear over the sound of the shower. He stuck his head
out. "Did you say something?" he called towards the others.
"Yes," answered Captain Memory. "I said: `Watch out for the
trap!'"
"WHAT?!" Ernie leaped out of the shower. He was about to run
into the next room, when suddenly it occurred to him that he was
stark naked and dripping wet. He decided to take a moment to grab
a towel and wrap it around himself; he wasn't prepared to face the
ridicule he would have gotten otherwise. "What trap!? Where's the
trap?!"
"You're holding it," Captain Memory gestured at Ernie.
"The TOWEL?!" Ernie almost flung it away, but decided against
it.
"No, your other hand!" Ernie looked at his left hand. He was
still unconsciously clutching the bottle of shampoo. "This? This
bottle of shampoo?" Ernie examined it. "What is it, a bomb or
something?"
"No, it's a bottle of shampoo," Captain Memory agreed.
"So what's the big deal?" Ernie felt a little foolish getting
all upset over a bottle of shampoo.
"What kind of shampoo is it?" Captain Memory prompted.
"Placental Protein Shampoo? What's wrong with that?"
"Do you know what a placenta is?"
"Yeah. It's the thing that feeds an embryo in the womb." Ernie
had gotten an `A' in biology, and was proud of it.
"Ever wonder what proteins from embryos are doing in your
shampoo?"
"Uh, now that you mention it, that does seem a little
strange," Ernie admitted.
"Ever wonder `proteins from embryos of WHAT'?" the Captain
prodded. "Or, `what KIND of proteins'?"
"I don't like the sound of this," Ernie said quietly.
Captain Memory went on. "DNA is a protein, you know."
Ernie thought a moment. "You mean, DNA, like in genetic
material, like `basic building blocks of life', the stuff that
determines what every kind of life form is going to be?"
"That's right," the Captain agreed. "Now, what do you suppose
would happen to you if you rubbed alien DNA from unborn space
creatures onto your scalp, where it could seep right down into your
brain?"
Ernie looked at the bottle of shampoo uneasily. "You mean, it
could, like, take over your brain?"
"Could be," Captain Memory agreed. "However, it doesn't work
all at once. It has to seep in little by little. The more you wash
your hair, the worse it gets."
Ernie was suddenly glad he didn't wash his hair too often. He
thought for a moment. "So, people who wash their hair a lot would
get it the worst, right?"
"You got it," Captain Memory assented cheerfully.
Ernie considered the problem. "So, who washes their hair the
most?"
"Pretty girls!" the Fly chimed in. "They wash their hair every
day, sometimes more than once. I know, 'cause every time I ask one
out one, she says `I can't go today, I gotta wash my hair'!"
"That's true," Ernie admitted. He thought a moment.
 "Wait a minute! We have this stuff at home. In fact, my girlfriend
uses it!"
The Captain considered this. "Noticed any changes in her
recently?"
"Well, she has been kind of...cold," Ernie conceded. "And, now
that you mention it, I have noticed her skin getting kind of scaly,
but I thought it was just the heartbreak of psoriasis. I tried to
say something about it, but she hissed at me!"
"Mmm hmm," Captain Memory agreed.
"Y'know, I noticed that a lot too," the Fly added. "I'm real
observant, and I noticed that an awful lot of pretty girls nowadays
have forked tongues!"
Ernie frowned. He had noticed something odd about his
girlfriend's tongue, but he hadn't wanted to mention it. He didn't
want to get hissed at again.
"They also have real sharp teeth," the Fly continued. "And
slit pupils in their eyes. I don't think that's normal, do you?"
All of this was making Ernie very unhappy. "You mean, aliens
are trying to take over the Earth?" he asked.
"I wouldn't doubt it," Captain Memory answered cheerfully.
"Well, what are we going to do about it?!" cried Ernie.
"Oh, you don't need to worry about it," said the Captain
reassuringly.
"Why not?" asked Ernie suspiciously.
"It's just a game anyway, right?" The Captain gave Ernie a
cheery smile, and helped himself to a piece of lemon meringue pie.
"There is one thing you could do," Sterno added.
"What?!" asked Ernie desperately.
"You could put some clothes on," Sterno said, looking ruefully
at the peach frappe' on his plate. "The sight of all that naked
skin is rather spoiling my appetite."
"Oh, all right!" Ernie snapped, stomping off to the
bathroom.
Sterno sighed. "Some people are so sensitive!" he commented,
reaching for a large Cherries Jubilee.
Ernie was somewhat placated to find that the luster had
returned to his toreador suit. The only thing worse than having to
go around in a toreador outfit was having to go around in a DIRTY
toreador outfit. He returned to the main room.
The Fly was eating what seemed to be large cookies of some
kind. "Hey, these are good gingerbread men!" he remarked, offering
one to Ernie.
Ernie examined the cookie. "It's not a man," he said
thoughtfully. "It looks like a gingerbread...reptile."
The Fly looked at the cookies. "Yeah, you're right." He
vacuumed another one up through his snout. "They're good, though."
Ernie looked at the cookie ruefully. "I don't know if I want
to eat a reptile."
"Might as well," Captain Memory volunteered. "It wouldn't
hesitate to eat you!"
Ernie put the cookie down quickly. He seemed to have lost his
appetite again.
Ernie heard footsteps approaching the house. A man in a post
office uniform, carrying a bag of mail, was coming up the walk.
"Howdy!" the mailman said cheerfully. "Nice day, isn't it?"
"Uh, yeah." Ernie thought he should be the one to answer,
since everyone else had their mouths full.
The mailman chatted on cheerily. "Had a few Nazis a mite
earlier, but it looks like it cleared up!" He looked through his
mail. "Is there a `Mr. Ernest Ross' here?"
"Uh, that's me," Ernie answered unenthusiastically.
"Here you go!" The mailman handed Ernie a letter. "Have a nice
day!" He left.
Ernie opened the letter and read:

"Dear Mr. Ross,

We are still awaiting payment on your unpaid balance of
$195,412,771,213,312,032.29. This account is now two billion years
and two days overdue. Do not force us to turn this matter over to
a collection agency. Don't let a little matter like this ruin your
credit rating. You don't want the shame of having your name dragged
through the mud, do you? You will never be allowed to buy anything
on credit ever again. People on the street will point at you and
jeer. Your entire family will be ostracized from decent society.
Your dog will turn upon you. Your aged parents will be thrown out
of their home, your children will be spat upon, even your
childrens' children, yea, unto the seventh generation!
Save yourself from embarrassment and inconvenience by paying
this balance now! Use the enclosed envelope for your remittance."
Ernie looked between the pages. There was no enclosed envelope. He
read on.
"Sincerely,

First National Bank of the West

P.S. If you are experiencing financial difficulties at the moment,
please contact one of our representatives to work out a payment
plan. As little as a trillion dollars a month could satisfactorily
take care of this account. Thank you!"
Ernie sighed. "Isn't there anywhere you can go to get away
from junk mail?"
"I doubt it," answered Captain Memory, cutting himself a big
slice of pineapple upside-down cake.
Ernie sighed, and sat down on the nearest piece of furniture,
which happened to be a child's rocking chair which was a bit too
small for him. Ernie noticed, while squeezing himself into it, that
the arms were scraping some of the sequins off his suit. Looking
down, he noticed that sequins had been falling off his suit all
along, leaving a sparkly trail as he walked. Oh great, he thought.
Now, on top of everything else, my suit is shedding.
Captain Memory looked at his bare wrist. "I guess it must be
just about time for the Eggplant Uprising," he commented.
"The what?" Ernie was confused, as usual.
"Oh, come on!" The Captain was annoyed. "Don't you pay
attention to anything I tell you? You know, the Revolt of the
Vegetables, the Purple Menace; remember, when they nuked us back to
the Stone Age?"
"Oh, sure," Ernie remembered being nuked well enough. He had
some vague recollection of the other stuff, too. He decided to
pretend he remembered the rest of it as well, since he was tired of
being picked on for not paying attention. "So, uh, what about it?"
"Well, anyway," the Captain went on. "After the Great Traffic
Jam..."
"The what?!" Ernie broke in involuntarily.
"Oh, you're right," said the Captain, slightly abashed. "I
didn't tell you about that. The Great Traffic Jam took place
because of this problem they had due to chronic over-production of
cars. You see, they just kept building all these cars, and people
kept buying them, just for the heck of it, even though they didn't
have anyplace to go in them. Well, of course, it had to happen: one
particularly nice summer day everybody decided to go for a drive
all at the same time. They wound up bumper-to-bumper, coast-to-
coast. The entire country was tied up in total gridlock. People
didn't know what to do; they didn't know how to get around without
their cars anymore. It was terrible; there was mass starvation.
Thousands died; vultures picked their bones through their
convertible tops. Well, I'm sure you can see that under
circumstances like these, people were in no mood for a practical
joke!"
"Uh, right!" Ernie thought he'd just agree, and maybe the
Captain would go on with the story without noticing that Ernie
wasn't following the story at all.
Ernie was lucky. The Captain continued: "Well, you can imagine
how people felt when rumors began to fly about certain species of
giant plants that had escaped from the atomic testing laboratories
and had grown to enormous size by feasting on human flesh. And how
these plants were determined to get revenge on the entire animal
kingdom for the millions of years of abuse they and their plant
brothers had had to put up with at the hands (and paws, and
muzzles, and so on) of non-vegetable life forms."
Ernie furled his brow. "Does that have anything to do with the
Vegetable Rights Movement?"
"You got it!" agreed Captain Memory. 
Ernie felt a sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach. In
spite of himself, he WAS beginning to remember all this! He didn't
WANT to remember it, because if he remembered it, that meant....
Ernie didn't want to think about what that meant.
"Anyway," the Captain continued. "They were going to organize
all the vegetables, stage a massive uprising, and eliminate all
animal life for ever! On top of all this, these plants were
invulnerable to conventional weapons, and could only be destroyed
by the atomic fires that had created them!
"Small wonder, then, that general panic broke out when
something very large and very purple raised it's leafy head over
the city of Chicago." Captain Memory chuckled.
"Oh, wow!" said Ernie. This was really creepy. It was a lot
like telling ghost stories around the campfire at camp. "So, it was
a giant, man-eating eggplant?"
"Don't be silly! How could there be a such a thing as a giant,
man-eating eggplant?" Captain Memory was amused. "No, it was just
practical joke. It was that zany Andreas Labyrinth and his band of
merry pranksters, up to their little games again." Captain Memory
chortled. "I still remember that phony Russian invasion. That was
really a riot! Or how about that bogus epidemic! That had everybody
in stitches!"
Something about that explanation didn't seem quite right to
Ernie, but he wasn't in the mood to try to figure out what it was.
He wanted to hear the rest of Captain Memory's story. "So then what
happened, uh, will happen, uh...so, what about the Eggplant?"
"Well, as I was saying," Captain Memory always enjoyed telling
stories. "It wasn't really a giant Eggplant, it was really just a
big purple balloon. But it looked a lot like a giant eggplant, you
know, big scary face painted on it and all. I suppose, in saner
times, people might have questioned the whole thing a little more
closely. After all, there wasn't really any proof that it was a
giant eggplant. It could have been a giant grape. No reason to nuke
a giant grape, is there?"
"I guess not." Ernie supposed he might as well agree, since he
couldn't think of any reason on Earth to nuke a giant grape.
"But, people just didn't stop and think," the Captain went on.
"They just went ahead and dropped the bomb. And when they found
out, boy, were they mad!" Captain Memory chuckled. "Of course, it
isn't really funny if it doesn't make somebody mad, is it? That's
what practical jokes are all about!"
Captain Memory paused. "But, anyway, all of this should be
taking place just about" he looked at his bare wrist, "Now!" A
sound like that of distant thunder shook the house.
Ernie looked out the window. "Chicago?" he asked.
"Yup!" answered the Captain. "There it goes!"
Ernie thought a moment. "Did they nuke Chicago twice?"
"Why would they want to do something like that?" Captain
Memory wondered. "Once you nuke it, it stays nuked!"
"Well, in that case," Ernie pondered. "How could we be in
Chicago just before it got nuked, before, when we're here just
before it got nuked, now?"
Captain Memory frowned. "That is confusing, isn't it? I've
never quite figured that out." The Captain didn't seem overly upset
about the problem.
Ernie decided that it probably wouldn't be good for him to
think about that problem anymore. He decided to think about
something else.
"So, what ever happened to that practical joker, that Andreas
Whats-His-Name?" he asked.
As if in answer to this question, a figure burst through the
door. It was an older man, with a wild white beard and hair. His
clothes were in tatters, and he was covered with splotches of egg,
rotten tomatoes, and other things too disgusting to think about.
"Hide me, hide me!" he implored. "They're after me! They'll tear me
to pieces! It was just a joke! I didn't know they'd take it
seriously! It was just a practical joke!"
"Well..."Ernie began.
Suddenly, the man seemed to see Ernie clearly for the first
time. "A BULLFIGHTER!" He looked at Captain Memory. "A comic-book
character!" He looked at the Fly. "A GIANT FLY!"
"What IS your problem?" Sterno demanded.
"A TALKING DOG!" the man shrieked. "You're all worse than me!
I've got to get out of here! They'll tear you all to pieces!" With
that, the man threw himself through the nearest window, which,
luckily, had been glazed with large panes of sugar instead of
glass. He sprinted towards a group of trees behind the house, and
disappeared into a large hole beneath one of them. Ernie thought he
saw a large white rabbit with a watch disappear into the hole as
well, but he wasn't sure.
Captain Memory looked at his bare wrist. "I'd really like to
get a watch," he commented. "It doesn't have to be anything fancy.
A Timex would be okay."
The Fly was looking out the door. "Uh oh," he said ominously.
"Here they come!"
"Here WHO comes?" Ernie demanded anxiously.
"The angry villagers!" the Fly said unhappily. "You know, with
the torches and the rocks and everything? You don't want to mess
with the angry villagers, man. They're mean!" They Fly shuddered.
He seemed to have had some kind of bad experience with them in the
past.
"Uh, maybe we ought to get out of here?" Ernie suggested.
"I haven't finished my strawberry mousse!" Sterno said
petulantly.
"Oh man, I don't know what we're gonna do," said the Fly
miserably. "They're closing in on us from all sides!"
Ernie peered through the broken window. He could see the smoke
from their torches in the distance. It occurred to him that perhaps
they should barricade the door, or something. Unfortunately, the
door had already been broken off its hinges by the Nazis. Ernie put
it upright in the doorframe as best he could, and shoved a small
rocking chair up against it to hold it.
"I don't think that's gonna stop anybody," the Fly said
glumly. 
Ernie could hear angry shouts. The villagers were approaching
fast. "I think we better do something!" Ernie urged Captain Memory.
"Oh yeah?" Captain Memory looked up unconcernedly. "Like
what?"
With a crash, a rock came sailing through on of the unbroken
windows. The angry shouts were quite close now. Ernie couldn't
understand them, though. They seemed to be in German.
A burning torch came sailing through an open window. Another
landed just outside the door. Thick black smoke began to fill the
air.
"Ew, burning sugar!" complained Sterno. "How rank!"
The Fly peeked out a window. "Oh man, those angry villagers!
They're bad news!"
"Hey, this place is burning up!" Ernie urged Captain Memory.
"We've got to DO something!"
Captain Memory made a wry face. "Well, I guess there's no
point in hanging around HERE anymore!" He thought a moment. "Let's
try 011F 0D 0001!" The scene vanished.

***

Blinking, Ernie found himself once again in an entirely
different place. He staggered, and his stomach flip-flopped. "Oh,
man", he moaned. "I don't know if I can take these sudden changes
of scene anymore."
"Oh," Captain Memory seemed surprised. "Would you rather be
back at the gingerbread cottage?" 
Ernie straightened up abruptly. "No, no that's okay. I'm fine,
just fine. I"d just as soon be right...um... He looked around.
Captain Memory, the Fly, and Sterno were all looking around as
well. They were in what appeared to be a large government office.
It was a big room, with a high, arched ceiling, lit by rows of
fluorescent lights. The walls were painted eye-saver green. `It
looks like an old-fashioned post office or something,' Ernie
thought. 
In the middle of the room was a long row of tables with forms
in little pigeonholes and pens attached by chains. A row of windows
occupied one wall, each with a bored-looking clerk doing something
with papers. A sign above the windows said `Federal Bureau of
Drawers'. 
Ernie was puzzled. "Why did you bring us here?" He asked
Captain Memory.
"This isn't quite what I expected," admitted the Captain. He
seemed just as puzzled as Ernie. "Actually, I didn't really want to
leave. I really wanted to have another piece of cake - German
chocolate, as a matter of fact." He sighed. "I guess I won't get my
cake now."
Ernie sighed as well. He wished he had taken advantage of the
opportunity to eat something while they were still at the cottage.
He was beginning to get really hungry, and it didn't look like he
was going to be able to find anything to eat here.
Ernie looked around. "What is this place?"
The Captain regarded the building thoughfully. "I'm not sure,
but I think it's a database."
"A database?" Ernie was confused. "I thought data in
Cyberspace was supposed to look like big, glowing geometric forms
that you could fly around in!"
"Yeah, well you could do that if you wanted," the Captain
explained. "But businesses usually don't. They secretaries don't
like 'em. They like something a little more, you know, traditional.
Like this!" He gestured at the building around them.
Their discussion was interrupted by a shrill, nasal voice.
"Next, please!" Ernie looked around confusedly. "That's you!" An
unpleasant-looking older woman with her hair pulled back in a tight
bun seemed to be pointing at him. "Step up to the window, please!"
Ernie looked at Captain Memory. "What should we do?"
The Captain shrugged. "I guess we should step up to the
window." They did so.
"Hello!" Captain Memory said pleasantly to the woman behind
the window. "Can you tell us why we're here?"
"Certainly," she said through tight lips.
Captain Memory smiled. "See," he said to Ernie. "This isn't
going to be hard at all!" 
The woman behind the window smirked unpleasantly. "Just fill
out this form." She handed a thick sheaf of papers to Captain
Memory.
The Captain's face fell. "What's this for?"
The woman smirked happily. "That's a form 4729, `Request for
Information'. I assume you have your authorized Form 7391 with
you?"
"Uh, I don't think so," the Captain answered confusedly. "What
is it?"
"Oh, you must have your Form 7391, `Request for Request for
Information' completely filled out, authorized, and validated
before we can process your Form 4729, `Request for Information'.
Oh, you don't have a Form 7391? Here you are!" The woman handed
Captain Memory another thick sheaf of papers.
Captain Memory looked very unhappy. He leafed though the
forms. "These are real long," he complained.
"Be sure to read ALL the directions," the woman simpered
cheerfully. Her mood seemed to be improving with every passing
form. "And fill in all the blanks, except those marked `Do Not Fill
In This Blank'. Of course, if you fail to fill in any of the
correct blanks, or if you should happen to fill in any blank marked
`Do Not Fill In This Blank', then you'll have to start ALL over
again!" She cackled with glee at the thought.
"And, of course, you'll need a Form 6729, `Request for
Authorization of Forms', a Form 3451, `Request for Validation of
Forms', a Form 4472b, `Request for Instructions for Authorization
and Validation of Forms', and a Form 2392A, `Application for
Verification of Authorization and Validation.'" She handed Captain
Memory four more thick forms.He now had a pile of forms about
eight inches high in front of him. "And, of course," she said to
Ernie "We'll need a complete set of forms from you as well," she
handed Ernie a similar stack of papers. "And from you, and from
you." She handed the Fly and Sterno each their own stack. The woman
seemed positively ecstatic now. 
Ernie looked at the pile in shock. "There's... there's
thousands of them!"
"Oh yes," said the woman gleefully. "There used to be only
hundreds, but ever since they passed the Paperwork Reduction Act
we've had far more!"
Ernie regarded the papers with dismay.
"After you've filled all those out," the woman continued
delightedly. "We'll start on the rest!"
The foursome took their piles of forms to the tables in the
middle of the room and began leafing through them despondently.
"These government offices are always so depressing," Sterno
complained. "Why must they always paint them that ghastly shade of
green?"
Ernie decided that he agreed with Sterno, but he was too
depressed to talk. He began leafing listlessly through his Form
2392, `Application for Verification of Authorization and
Validation', for no other reason than that it happened to be at the
top of the pile. It started out straightforwardly enough:

Name:Social Security #:
Father's Name:Mother's Name:
Mother's Maiden Name:
DO NOT WRITE IN THIS SPACE


Grandfather's Name:
Grandmother's Name:
Ernie tried to fill in his name, but the pen on the little
chain wouldn't write. Instead, he flipped a few pages ahead.

Great Grandmother on your Father's Mother's Side's Maiden Name:
Great Grandmother on your Father's Mother's Side's Dependent
Children Living with Her at the Time of Marriage (if any) Names:
DO NOT WRITE IN THIS SPACE
STOP! Did you write in this space? If so, take the letters of
your name, add their numerical equivalents to your date of birth,
and turn to the appropriate section as indicated by the table on
page 349. Follow directions carefully. Then, discard this form and
start all over. 
Ernie sighed. He leafed ahead a few more pages. 

ENTER ONE OF THE FOLLOWING:
(a)Your Adjusted Gross Income, minus Unrecovered
Depreciation otherwise deductible on Form 692A, but including
Accrued Losses not otherwise reported on this Form.
(b)The sum total of all the money you ever made in your
entire life.
(c)The sum total of the sum total of all the money you
ever made in your entire life AND all the money your father and/or
mother made in their entire lives OR;
(d)How much you got?
Complete the above and roll again. If doubles, forfeit one
turn. Otherwise, proceed to the nearest RR and pay owner TWICE what
he would otherwise receive. Do NOT pass GO; do NOT collect $200.

DO NOT WRITE IN THIS SPACE


Ernie looked up. "Do you get the feeling they're playing games
with us?" he asked the others.
"Oh NO!" cried the Fly desperately.
"What!?" said Ernie, alarmed.
"I wrote in the space that says `Do Not Write in This Space'",
wailed the Fly.
"Tsk, tsk," said Sterno. "You're in big trouble now!"
Ernie was glad that it was someone other than himself who was
in big trouble, for a change. He looked over at Captain Memory.
The Captain was having a hard time filling out his forms. He
seemed to have gotten stuck. Ernie looked over his shoulder. As a
matter of fact, the Captain seemed to have gotten stuck on the
first space, `NAME:'. "Should I put `Captain Memory' or `Memory,
Captain?'" he mused.
Ernie noticed that the Captain's form was different from his.
Ernie read:

NAME:
RANK:
SERIAL NUMBER:
In twenty-five (25) words or less, explain how you manage to
travel through Cyberspace without stopping at the approprite
checkpoints and/or checksums. Be concise; use specific examples,
and remember, neatness counts!
If you need more room, use a separate sheet.

DO NOT WRITE IN THIS SPACE

"I know!" said Captain Memory. "I can put `Memory' under
`Name:', and `Captain' under `Rank:'. I wonder what I should put
under `Cereal Number:'?"
Ernie suddenly became very uneasy. "I think maybe we should
just get out of here while we have the chance!"
Sterno was leafing through his pile of papers. "Aha!" he
cried. "Here we go: Form 1193, `Request for Authorization to Apply
for a License to Purchase Cigars'! Now we're getting somewhere!"
Sterno did not find the forms upsetting at all. In fact, he seemed
to be the only one able to deal with them. He began scribbling
industriously in the blanks. As Ernie watched, he took his sheaf of
forms to one of the windows, where it was stamped. He then took it
to another window, where a large gold seal was affixed to it. Then
on to another window, where several people signed it. He then
disappeared around a corner, and returned, moments later, carrying
a large box of cigars.
"Wow!" The Fly was awestruck. "That's amazing! I wonder how he
does that!"
"It's not really that difficult," commented Sterno, lighting
up a big cigar. His disposition always improved tremendously when
he had a cigar. "I'll tell you a secret: the universe is actually
a giant bureaucracy. It's possible to get anything in the Cosmos
done, if you fill out the right forms. However, filling out the
right forms can sometimes be very difficult indeed." He puffed his
cigar appreciatively. "Havanas, no less! One needs a special permit
to get these, I'll have you know!" 
The Fly, meanwhile, was intent on trying to erase what he had
written in the space marked `Do Not Write in This Space'. So far,
he had only succeeded in tearing a hole in the paper.
Ernie, meanwhile, was noticing the fact that all the clerks
and tellers seemed to be watching them. Another unusual thing
struck him. "Hey guys," he commented. "Did you notice that there's
all these clerks and all these officials, but no customers besides
us?"
"Egad, that IS odd," agreed Sterno. "Everyone knows that the
usual ratio is 116,312 customers per clerk." He looked around.
"Where ARE all the lines? I've never seen a government office this
empty, except of course at the Administration for Not Doing
Anything At All Building, and even there only after 5:00 P.M. on
weekends. It does seem suspicious!"
Ernie was thrilled that for once, someone agreed with him.
"Okay, well that proves it, right? So let's get out of here, okay?"
"I've got it!" cried Captain Memory. He grabbed a pen, and
wrote in large, childlike block letters in the space marked `Serial
Number:' `FROSTED FLAKES'. "There!" he said, beaming. He looked at
the next line, and his face fell. "Oh, it's an essay question! I
hate essay questions!"
"So let's get out of here, okay?" Ernie urged. He felt more
uneasy with each passing moment.
Captain Memory sighed. "I guess we might as well. I'm never
gonna finish this thing!" He pushed the pile of papers aside. Ernie
began slowly heading toward the door, acutely aware of all the
clerks watching him. He tried to act as nonchalant as possible,
whistling a little tune and shuffling his feet as he walked.
"Just a minute!" he heard the old woman clerk cry out. "Just
WHERE do you think you're going?"
"Uh..uh.." Ernie stammered.
"Don't you know you're not allowed to leave without filling
out a Form 9150, `Application for Authorization to Apply for
Permission for an Interruption in Completion of Forms'!" she
shrieked. "Get back here!"
Ernie thought fast. "Uh, I gotta go to the bathroom!"
The old woman glared at the other three. "And what about YOU?"
The others followed Ernie's lead. "Uh, we all gotta go to the
bathroom!" they chorused in unison.
The clerk scowled. "All right! Fill out this Form 7711,
`Request for Permission to Apply for Authorization for Admission to
the Sanitary Facility'!" she snapped. "Anyway, you're going the
wrong way! The bathroom's that way!" She pointed down a long
corridor which seemed to disappear into the bowels of the building.
Ernie looked at the others. "RUN!!" he yelled. They all
sprinted for the door.
"Stop them!" shrieked the old woman, but they were already
through the door.
Outside, they found themselves on the dingy streets of what
appeared to be a large city greatly in need of urban renewal. "We'd
better keep moving," Ernie urged. "They're right behind us!"
The Fly looked back. "No, they're not."
Ernie stopped, confused, and turned around. Sure enough, there
was no sign of pursuit. "Why aren't they chasing us?" Ernie
wondered.
"Oh, here's the reason," said Captain Memory regarding his
bare wrist. "It's five o'clock. Civil servants never work past
five!"He continued to regard his bare wrist. "I'd really like to
get a watch!" 
Ernie breathed a sigh of relief. "So, we're safe, then?"
"At least till nine o'clock tomorrow morning," Captain Memory
agreed. He looked around brightly. "Let's go for a walk! Maybe we
can find a jewelry store somewhere around here!" Captain Memory
paused reflectively, looking at his bare wrist. "It doesn't have to
be a Rolex. A Seiko would be okay. Of course, I wouldn't mind a
Rolex!" They began strolling down the street.
As they neared the corner, they began to hear music in the
distance. Ernie recognized the sound of steel drums and guitars.
"Reggae!" he said. "Somebody's playing reggae music around here!"
Ernie relaxed. While he wasn't a particular fan of reggae music, it
made him fell more at home to come across anything at all he could
recognize.
As they turned the corner, they came upon a group of black
people who seemed to be having a party. They wore bright-colored
clothes, and had their hair hanging down in long braids.
"Dreadlocks!" Ernie recognized. "They must be Rastafarians!" 
The Fly seemed totally confused by these people. "Hey, guy!"
he said to one of them. "Uh, do you live around here?"
"Oh, no mon," the man answered in a thick Jamaican accent. "We
not from here, mon. We from de Islands. We Rastas!"
In spite of himself, Ernie found himself becoming suspicious.
For one thing, they didn't look like other black people Ernie knew.
There was something funny about their skin tone. It was unusually
black, and it seemed to be coming off on objects around them. Out
of a corner of his eye, Ernie noticed a trash can nearby. It seemed
to be full of empty bottles of black shoe polish.
Another of the Rastafarians approached the Fly. "Hey,
brother," he said, pointing at the Fly's antenna. "You got de
dreadlocks too, I see. Here, smoke some of dis ganja!" He handed
the Fly a funny-looking cigarette.
"Uh, thanks." The Fly accepted the cigarette. However, he
couldn't seem to fit it into his snout, no matter which way he held
it.
Ernie heard the reassuring strains of Bob Marley and the
Wailers drifting out through a nearby doorway, but he was unable to
shake his suspicions. He noticed something unusual about the man's
footwear. "Since when do Rastas wear jackboots?"
The man seemed momentarily nonplussed, but quickly recovered
his composure. "Oh sure, mon. We all wear de jackboots now. It's de
new `in' thing." He turned to the Fly. "Ain't dat right, brother?"
The Fly had managed to get a grip on the cigarette with his
snout, and was puffing away. He started to giggle. "Jackboots!
Sure! Why not!"
"Dere you go, mon," the Rasta said reassuringly, while taking
out a monocle and fitting it into his eye. "You got nothin' to
worry about! We just Rastas, mon. We not Nazis, or nothin'!" He
laughed. "Oh, no!"
The Fly was giggling uncontrollably now. "Hey, that's GREAT
music!" he said enthusiastically. "You guys are really alright!
This is FUN!" He broke down into fits of hysterical giggling.
"Take it easy, mon," the Rasta said to Ernie. "My name's Jack.
I from Monterey. Dey call me Monterey Jack!"
Sterno stiffened. "Monterey Jack! Do you know what that is!?"
he hissed. "It's...it's CHEESE!"
The Rasta stood abruptly up, the monocle dropping out of his
eye. "SEIZE THEM!" he shrieked, his Islands accent abruptly
vanishing.
"RUN!" shouted Ernie and Sterno together.
"Hey guys, what's the rush?" asked the Fly, his head lolling
from side to side. "Isn't this a FUN party?"
"Come ON!" Ernie grabbed the Fly's tie and pulled him along
like a puppy on a leash. The ran down the narrow street, the Fly
stumbling and giggling. Close behind them were the imitation
Rastas, discarding their Caribbean clothes as they ran to reveal
Nazi uniforms beneath. "Quick, in here!" Ernie pulled the Fly into
an open doorway, followed by Sterno and Captain Memory. Inside was
a flight of stairs. They ran up the stairs and through a door at
the first landing, to find themselves in a long corridor, lined by
rows of doors.
"Looks like an apartment building, or maybe a hotel," Ernie
observed. "Maybe we can find a room to hide in!"
"Good idea!" Sterno agreed.
"I'd like a room with a TV, if you don't mind," Captain Memory
added. Ernie glared at him, and hurried down the hall, still
dragging the Fly by the necktie.
An open door beckoned. The four rushed into what appeared to
be an ordinary, somewhat run-down hotel room, slammed the door
behind them, and locked it.
"Whew!" Ernie breathed a sigh of relief. "Well, I don't think
they can find us in here! Look's like we're safe!"
The Fly collapsed into an overstuffed chair. He held his hands
up in front of his face. "Oh wow," he said wonderingly. "Did you
ever look at your hands? I mean, really LOOK at them?" He started
giggling again.
"Hmmph!" Sterno sniffed. "Some people just can't hold their
ganja!"
There was a knock on the door.
"Ssh!" Ernie cautioned the others. "Let's just be quiet and
they won't know we're in here!"
"Ve know you're in dere!" a voice outside the door shouted.
Ernie was astonished. "How could they know we were in here?"
he whispered to the others.
"Dat's easy!" answered the voice from behind them door. "Ve
just follow ze trail of sequins!"
Ernie looked at his toreador suit. Large, sparkle-less patches
confirmed his worst fears. Sure enough, a faint, but clearly
identifiable trail of sequins led under the door.
Ernie became aware of everyone glaring at him, except of
course, the Fly, who was still busily examining his hands. "You,
again!" snarled Sterno.
"Well, hey..." Ernie shrugged defensively. "What am I supposed
to do, you know? I..."
The knock sounded again, this time louder. "Open up!"
Ernie looked at the door. I'll be cool about this, he decided.
Maybe I can fake them out. "Uh, yes?" he called out brightly.
"Who's there?"
"Nazis!" came the reply. "Open up!"
"Uh, no thanks! We don't want any!"
"You vill open zis door! NOW!"
Ernie thought fast. "Uh, I'm in the bathroom right now! Could
you come back later?"
"BREAK DOWN ZE DOOR!" Something large and heavy thudded into
the door.
Ernie looked around the room frantically. "The fire escape!"
Ernie pointed through an open window. "Quick! Everybody! Out that
way!" The ran to the window and climbed down the fire escape, Ernie
pulling the Fly by the necktie. "Hey, what's the rush, guys?" asked
the Fly, giggling. "We just got here!"
As they hurried down the fire escape, Ernie heard the sound of
the door breaking down behind them. "After zem!" a voice cried.
The bottom of the fire escape led to a narrow alley. Hurrying
along it, the found themselves facing a large iron door. There was
no other way out of the alley. The sounds of pursuit were close
behind them. Ernie tried the doorknob. It was unlocked. "Quick,
through here!" he shouted.
They four scrambled through the door and slammed it behind
them. Inside it was totally dark. Ernie felt along the doorframe
for a lock. He found one, and locked it. He found another, and
locked that too. There was also a large bolt, and a huge padlock.
He locked those as well. "There," he said. "That should keep them
out. We're safe now!" He breathed a sigh of relief.
"Where are we?" he heard Captain Memory's voice ask. "I can't
see a thing!" 
Ernie inched carefully forward, his hands outstretched, hoping
to find a lamp, or a light switch, or something. Suddenly, from out
of the darkness, a voice rang out. "Ah, how nice of you to return!"
the voice said. "Ve haff been vaiting for you!"
"Uh oh," Ernie began. "I think we're in trouble guys!"
The now-familiar voice of the game-show announcer boomed out.
"You sure are, because it's time for WHEEL OF TORTURE!"
There was the sound of tremendous applause.
The entire scene erupted into blinding light. 
The announcer continued. "And now, for our first contestant:
from Toledo, Ohio, it's Goombah the Toreador!"
"My name's Ernie," Ernie complained. "Gimme a break, huh?"
"SURE!" the announcer agreed cheerfully. "WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE
BROKEN?!" Ernie heard uproarious laughter.
"Say!" the announcer continued. "I just LOVE your suit! You're
missing a few sequins, though!" Ernie heard laughter again, this
time cut short in a very artificial-sounding way. His eyes were
beginning to adjust to the light, but he still couldn't see
clearly.
"And here's our second contestant: from Des Moines, Iowa, it's
Seth Brundage, the Human Fly!"
"Aw, I wish you wouldn't call me that!" the Fly complained.
"It makes a real bad impression, you know? Couldn't you just call
me `Seth'?"
"Sure thing, Mr. Fly!" the announcer agreed jovially.
The Fly moaned. "And I'm not from Des Moines, either!"
Ernie's vision was beginning to clear up. They were,
unfortunately, back on the stage of `Wheel of Torture'. They seemed
to have blundered (or been maneuvered) into the same stage they had
escaped from twice before. Ernie just hoped they would be able to
escape from it again.
He looked out towards the audience. There was no audience -
just empty chairs. Ernie looked around. There were no guards, no
chorus girls. In fact, there was only one person: the Gestapo's
greatest, Sturmbannfuhrer Dr. Heinz von Liederkranz, the man whose
name sounds like cheese! Ernie heard thunderous applause.
"Tank you, tank you!" von Liederkranz bowed in the direction
of the non-existent audience. He then reached out and shut off a
small tape recorder. The applause ended abruptly. He turned on
another small tape recorder. "And now, on with the show!" the
recorded voice of the announcer rang out. Von Liederkranz shut that
one off, too.
"Zo, ve meet again!" Von Liederkranz smiled unpleasantly. "Now
you are in my power! You vill tell me vhat I vant to know!"
Ernie looked at the empty chairs. "What happened to the
audience?"
Von Liederkranz's face turned hard. "Dat vas most...
unfortunate. Dey all refused to confess, und I vas forced to...
eliminate dem. For vhich..." He looked around quickly. Finding no-
one else around him, he settled on Ernie. "YOU vill pay,
schweinhund!" he cried, slapping Ernie with his riding crop.
"Why me!?" cried Ernie. "I didn't..."
"SILENCE!"
Von Liederkranz eyed them all suspiciously. "Unfortunately, I
vill not be able to interrogate you at de moment, due to a, um,
temporary staff shortage. Until zis situation can be remedied, I
vill be forced to keep you locked up. Zis time, however, you vill
not escape due to ze incompetence of guards! Ze guards have been...
liquidated." He smiled evilly. "Now, you vill go behind Door Nummer
One! MARSCH!" He gestured at them with an evil-looking
weapon. The foursome found themselves herded through Door Number
One, which crashed shut behind them with a very loud and ominous
clang.
Ernie looked around, his eyes slowly becoming accustomed to
the darkness. They seemed to be back in the same large dungeon cell
they had been held in before. The room was dimly lit by a torch
attached to one wall. The far reaches of the room disappeared into
the darkness, making it impossible to tell exactly how big the cell
was.
"Oh man," the Fly complained. "Not here again! This place is
no fun! I waited for my date in here for DAYS, man! She never
showed up! I couldn't even get a drink while I waited! The service
in here is terrible!" He peered into the darkness. "Waiter!
Waiter!" He sighed. "It doesn't do any good. Nobody ever comes!"
Ernie peered into the darkness. No, he couldn't see anything
that even remotely resembled a waiter. However, straining his ears,
he did seem to hear something. It sounded like sniffling, and
perhaps crying. "Who's there?" he called into the darkness.
Two small figures began to approach into the light. As they
approached, Ernie could see that they were children: a little boy
and a little girl. They were both dressed in German national
costumes. The girl was wearing a dirndl, and the boy was wearing
lederhosen and a little alpine hat. They both seemed very sad.
Ernie was surprised. "Hi there," he said to the little boy in
a kindly manner. "What's your name?"
"My name is Hansel," said the boy, with a heavy German accent.
"Und dis is my sister, Gretel."
The Fly regarded the children. "Say, you kids haven't seen my
date, have you? She's about five-foot-two, eyes of blue..." The
children looked at him uncomprehendingly. The Fly sighed. "Oh well,
it was worth a try."
Ernie regarded the children with amazement. "How did you kids
get here?"
Hansel sniffled sadly. "Ve vas arrested by ze Gestapo," he
explained. "Ve vas lost in ze forest, und ve found zis gingerbread
house, und a vicked vitch, und ve push her in ze oven." Hansel
sniffled tearfully. "How vas ve to know she vas a Gestapo agent?"
"Gee, that's tough, kid," Ernie said sympathetically. He hoped
Hansel wouldn't cry. He never knew what to do around crying
children.
"Well, cheer up, kid," Captain Memory added in brightly. "It
could be worse!"
"How?" asked Hansel innocently.
"Uh..." Captain Memory thought for a moment. "I'll get back to
you on that!" He fell silent.
Hansel whimpered. "It's so cold and dark and awful in here!
I'm afraid!"
Ernie winced. `Oh, he's gonna start crying', he thought. `What
am I gonna do? I don't know what to do when kids cry!' Ernie tried
to think of something to do. "Uh, cheer up kid! Maybe I'll tell you
a story!"
Hansel brightened. "Oh, do you know a good story?"
Ernie frowned. "Uh, well,...no." He turned to Captain Memory.
"Hey, tell these kids a story! You know lots of stories!"
"Tell us a story! Tell us a story!" The children jumped up and
down in front of Captain Memory.
The Captain seemed confused. "Well, uh, I dunno."
"Oh man," said the Fly. "You're not gonna disappoint these
poor little kids, are you? Tell 'em something!"
Captain Memory hesitated. "Well, gee. I don't know what to
tell them!"
Hansel jumped up and down excitedly. "Tell us how you travel
from sector to sector in Cyberspace vithout getting shtopped at ze
checkpoints! Tell us dat one!"
Ernie frowned. How did these kids know about that?
Gretel, too, was jumping up and down excitedly. "Tell us how
you can JUMP from places dat are not supposed to accept any
external commands! Tell us dat one!"
The Captain seemed unsure. "Well, I don't know if I should
talk about that!"
"Oh, sure!" said Hansel reassuringly. "You can tell us all
about it! Dere's no harm in it! Ve're just little kids! You can
tell us everything you know!"
"I really shouldn't..." the Captain began.
"Oh, come on," Hansel cajoled. "Why not? We're just little
kids who want to hear a story! We're not midgets, just little kids!
And," he laughed. "We're certainly not Gestapo agents!"
Gretel laughed too. "Oh no, we're not midget Gestapo agents,
nothing of the kind! How silly to even think such a thing!"
Hansel gestured at Gretel. "See? Dot proves it! Und ve're
certainly not trying to pump you for information, ve just vant you
to tell us a story, ja?"
Captain Memory breathed a sigh of relief. "Well, that's a load
off my mind!"
"Gut! Gut!" Hansel and Gretel beamed. "Now, you vill tell us
vhat ve vant to know, ja?"
"Sure!" said Captain Memory brightly. "Uh," he scratched his
head. "What were we talking about again?"
Hansel fumed. "Talk, schweinhund! Or else ve..." He noticed
Gretel glaring at him. He caught himself. "Oh, ja." He laughed
feebly. "You vill tell us how you JUMP from place to place, ja?" 
Sterno looked at the children suspiciously. "There's something
very peculiar about these children," he remarked. He looked them up
and down carefully. "You children," he demanded. "What is your LAST
NAME?"
Hansel and Gretel looked at each other in confusion. "Our
what?"
"You last name!" Sterno insisted. "Your first names are Hansel
and Gretel; what are your last names? Even Germans have last
names!"
Hansel and Gretel put their heads together and began
whispering furiously between them. "Last names...Dey didn't give
us...Vhat do ve say?" Finally, the looked up. "Uh, Colby! Dot's our
last name! Hansel and Gretel Colby! Ein gut name, ja?"
Sterno stiffened. "Do you know what that IS!?" he hissed.
"It's...it's CHEESE! COLBY CHEESE!"
A look of fury passed over both Hansel and Gretel's faces.
"Dummkopf!" Gretel screamed at Hansel. "You give away ze whole
show! Und ve vas zo close!"
"ME!?" Hansel shrieked back. "It vas you! You pick zis stupid
name!"
Suddenly, the door to the dungeon cell flew open. Von
Liederkranz stood in the doorway, framed in light. "Zo," he said
menacingly. "My liddle subterfuge does not fool you, eh? Dot is
most... unfortunate. Now I vill have to interrogate you meinself.
Out!" The entire group stepped out of the dungeon cell, and back
onto the stage of WHEEL OF TORTURE. 
Von Liederkranz turned to Hansel and Gretel. "Und as for YOU,"
They winced. "Such incompetence is not to be tolerated! You vill
perhaps step behind Door Nummer Four, ja?"
The midgets blanched. "NEIN! NEIN! Not Door Nummer Four!"
"MARSCH!" Von Liederkranz gestured toward the door with his
evil-looking weapon. The midgets filed sadly through the door,
which slammed shut behind them. Ernie heard two piercing, blood-
curdling screams, and then silence.
Shaken, he turned to Captain Memory. "What...what is behind
Door Number Four?"
The Captain shook his head sadly. "You DON'T want to know!"
Ernie thought for a moment, and decided that probably the
Captain was right.
Von Liederkranz smiled evilly. "Und now, ze interrogation! Too
bad you did not tell ze midgets ze story dey vanted to hear! It
vould have been much easier... for you!" He stopped, sniffing at
something in the air. "Vot is dat smell?" he inquired of no-one in
particular. His eyes lighted on Sterno, whose cigar smoke was
drifting his way. "Vot are you smoking?"
"Oh, care for one?" Sterno offered politely. "They're
Havanas!"
"Very nice!" Von Liederkranz accepted one. His eyes narrowed.
"Vhere did you get dese? It takes a special permit to buy dese!"
"Of course," Sterno agreed. "You need a Form 1193, `Request
for Authorization to Apply for a License to Purchase Cigars', and
you have to have it validated, verified, stamped, sealed, notarized
and signed; in triplicate, of course. Then you file it, wait for
your authorization number, and then..."
"I see!" Von Liederkranz interrupted. Of course, he didn't see
at all, but listening to this sort of thing gave him a headache.
"You must be very important, to have such privileges!"
Sterno puffed himself up proudly. "Well, as a matter of fact,
I..."
They were interrupted by a knock at the door. "Who dares to
interrupt me!?" von Liederkranz fumed.
"Mailman!" a cheerful voice answered.
"Vot do you vant?" von Liederkranz answered angrily. The same
cheerful-looking mailman entered. `How did he get through all those
locks?' Ernie wondered.
"I got a letter here for a Mr. Ernest Ross!" 
Ernie waved weakly. "Right here!" The mailman handed Ernie his
letter, and left.
Von Liederkranz was livid with rage. "Vhy do you get all ze
mail?!" he raged. "I myself am avaiting important communications,
but do I receive zem? No! YOU get all ze mail! Just last veek I vas
informed dat I may already have won TEN MILLION DOLLARS! Prize
Notification Central is supposed to contact me any day now! But do
I hear from zem? NO! I don't even get ze magazines I order from
zem, either! YOU get all ze mail!" Von Liederkranz raged. "Zis
makes me very angry! For vhich..." He looked quickly around. His
eyes lit on the Fly. "YOU vill pay, schweinhund!" He slapped the
Fly with his riding crop.
"Hey!" the Fly complained. "It's not my fault! Gimme a break,
huh?"
Von Liederkranz smiled evilly. "Vhat vould you like broken?
Heh, heh!"
The Fly frowned. "Hey, guys, we gotta think of some other
phrase to use around here! I don't think it's safe to say `Gimme
a...'" He looked uneasily at von Liederkranz, who was smirking
menacingly. "...uh, to say that thing we just said, you know?"
Ernie opened his letter and read, even though he had a sinking
feeling that he knew what it was going to say. He was right:

"Dear Mr. Ross,
We have been retained by the National Bank of the
West to investigate the matter of an unpaid credit card balance of
$195,412,771,213,312,032.29. We understand that this account is a
little over two billion years overdue. Perhaps this matter has
slipped your mind. Perhaps you think you've got better things to
do. Well, LISTEN, you lousy DEADBEAT, if we don't get that money by
noon tomorrow, we're gonna send Vito to collect it! This is gonna
make Vito very angry! Vito is gonna get this out of you, ONE WAY OR
THE OTHER, if you get my drift!So send us this money, PUNK, while
you still can!

Affectionately,

ACME COLLECTION AGENCY

P.S. If you have already sent in a check for this amount, please
disregard this letter. Have a nice day!"
The letter ended with a Smile face.
Ernie moaned. It was all just getting worse and worse.
"Give me zat letter!" von Liederkranz tore the letter out of
Ernie's hand. "Zo, just as ve thought!" he said, reading the letter
quickly and then tossing it aside. "Zo, you have problems vith
money, eh?" Ernie nodded, smiling weakly. "I can understand zat,"
said von Liederkranz commiseratingly. "I, too, have problems vith
money. In fact, I begin to see, now, vhere some of my problems come
from!" He pulled out a wicked-looking weapon and held it in Ernie's
face. "VHAT HAVE YOU DONE VITH MY PRIZE NOTIFICATION?!"
"ME!?" Ernie began. "I never..."
"Do not trifle vith me!" von Liederkranz snapped. He held the
weapon up for Ernie's inspection. "Do you know vhat zis is?"
"Well..." Ernie began.
"It is a pain generator," von Liederkranz went on menacingly.
"You vould like a taste, perhaps?"
"Well..." Ernie began again.
Von Liederkranz pulled the trigger. Instantly, Ernie's entire
body was engulfed in intense, searing pain. "YEEOW!"
VOn Liederkranz smirked evilly. "Ze pain generator has
intensity settings. Dat vas a number `1'. Ze numbers go up to
`100'. You vould like to try, perhaps, a `25'?"
Ernie blanched. All he could think of to say was "Well..."
There was a knock on the door. "Mailman!"
"AHA!" Von Liederkranz cried excitedly. "I knew it! ZE PRIZE
NOTIFICATION!" Von Liederkranz ran to the door and threw it open
frantically.
The door flew open, and von Liederkranz froze in horror. "MEIN
GOTT!" he shrieked. There, an inch outside the door, was a huge
Post Office dump truck, it's bed lifted, its tailgate open, ready
to dump. Von Liederkranz had time for only one short scream before
he was completely engulfed in a huge flood of slick paper
magazines.
Captain Memory shook his head sadly. "Poor guy, he should have
read the fine print. It clearly says that ordering all the
magazines won't increase your chances to win."
"Tough," Ernie said callously. After his brush with the pain
generator, he wasn't in the mood to be too sympathetic about
anything that happened to von Liederkranz. "So, why don't we get
out of here, okay?"
"Hmm," said Captain Memory thoughtfully. "`Out of here', you
say. Well, that's all well and good, I mean, anybody can just say
`let's get out of here', but..." He trailed off.
"Do you have a problem with that?" Ernie wanted to know.
"Well, um," said Captain Memory thoughtfully. "I'm not exacly
sure where we should go next. My last location didn't work out
quite the way I intended it."
"Hoow about the Dead Sea Phonograph Records?" Ernie suggested.
"Maybe we should go and check them out!"
"Will you get off that `Dead Sea Phonograph Records'
business?" Sterno snapped. "That's the most ridiculous thing I've
heard in...in..." He thought a moment. "...two billion years!"
"Well, have you got a better idea?" Ernie said exasperatedly.
"Loot, rape, and pillage," said the Fly thoughtfully.
"What!?" Ernie didn't know what to make of that statement at
all.
"You know," the Fly continued. "What the Nazi was saying,
`Loot, rape, and pillage'. It reminds me of something, but I can't
quite recall what." The Fly concentrated. "Doesn't it just drive
you crazy when you can almost think of something, and then, just
when you think you got it, it gets away from you?"
"I know what you mean," said Ernie sympathetically.
"Let me see now," said Captain Memory reflectively. He seemed
to be taking the Fly's problem very seriously. "That was: Rape,
Loot and Pillage?"
Sterno frowned. "I don't think that's right."
Captain Memory looked surprised. "What's wrong with it? It's
not a song title, is it?"
"No." Sterno thought a moment. "It could be a heavy-metal rock
song. But I don't think it is."
Captain Memory breathed a sigh of relief. "Well, that's one
less thing to worry about!" He fell silent; he seemed to be lost in
thought.
Sterno continued. "I think it's supposed to be `loot, pillage,
and rape'."
The Fly considered this. "`Loot, pillage, rape', not `loot,
rape, pillage'?"
"How about `pillage, rape, loot'?" Ernie chimed in.
The others glared at him. "Don't be ridiculous!" Sterno
snapped. 
"Attila the Hun!" the Fly cried excitedly.
"What?!" Ernie said exasperatedly. "What in the world does
that have to do with anything?"
"That's what I was trying to think of!" The Fly was jubilant.
"Boy, do I feel better!" He turned to Captain Memory. "Hey, it was
Attila the Hun!"
The Captain seemed to have sunk into a reverie. The Fly's
comment seemed to suddenly startle him out of it. "What? Oh, Attila
the Hun? Well, I guess. I can't think of anything better!" 
Ernie didn't like the sound of this. "Wait a minute! What..."
But it was too late. 
"0028 CE 21!" Captain Memory cried. The scene vanished.



CHAPTER 6

The foursome found themselves standing on a grassy hill. In
this distance a column of smoke rose heavenward from a village that
was being pillaged - possibly looted and raped as well (it was too
far to see).
"There you go, guys," said Captain Memory cheerfully. "Attila
the Hun! Now what?"
"What do you mean, `Now what?'?" Ernie demanded. "If you don't
know what we're going to do here, then why did you bring us here?"
"I thought you wanted to come here!" Captain Memory protested.
"It wasn't my idea! I was just trying to be nice! Actually, I
thought it was kind of a weird thing to do. I mean, we could have
gone to Vegas, we could have gone to Hawaii, but no, you want to go
see Attila the Hun!"
"Well, whose idea was it, then?" Ernie wanted to know.
"Well, it certainly wasn't MY idea!" Sterno demurred.
They all looked at the Fly. He shifted uncomfortably. "Hey, I
was just making conversation, you know? I didn't mean we should
actually come and SEE Attila the Hun. I don't even know the guy,
you know?"
Captain Memory chuckled. "How about that! We came all the way
to ancient Rome, and nobody really wanted to go at all! Funny how
things work out, isn't it? Well, I guess we'll just have to make
the best of it!"

Ernie looked out across the fields. "How can we be in anciant
Rome, anyway?" he asked.
"Educational software," the Captain explained. "THE HISTORY OF
THE WORLD database. All the schools have it."
"Oh." Ernie looked down. He noticed they were standing on a
road. He would have assumed it was one of the famous Roman Roads,
except that it was made of yellow brick. Ernie was almost certain
that the Romans didn't build their roads out of yellow bricks, but
he decided not to say anything about it, just in case he was wrong.
He was sick of being made fun of.
"I wonder where this road leads," Ernie speculated.
"Rome," Sterno answered with certainty.
"How do you know?" Ernie was skeptical.
"Everybody knows that," Sterno answered with authority. "`All
Roads Lead to Rome'!"
"Hey, that'll be fun!" the Fly chimed in. "Maybe we can get
togas! Maybe we can have a Toga party!" He started chanting. "Toga!
Toga! Toga!"
"Yeah, maybe we can get shot full of arrows by the Huns, too,"
Ernie added glumly.
They began walking down the yellow brick road. In the distance
a pall of smoke rose from nearby pillaged villages. "Hey, there's
a building up ahead!" the Fly observed.
They walked nearer. "Oh, it's a Roman villa! They're supposed
to be very luxurious! Let's take a look at it!"
Ernie was doubtful. "What if it's been pillaged?"
"Don't be ridiculous!" Sterno snapped. "It's a `villa', not a
`village'! You can't very well pillage a `villa'! It doesn't even
rhyme!"
"Oh...sorry," Ernie felt like he just couldn't stop making
mistakes.
"They education they give young people these days!" Sterno
sniffed. "It's just a disgrace! Whatever happened to the classical
education? Where I come from, EVERYONE who is ANYONE has a
classical education!"
"I don't have a classical education," the Fly commented.
"My point exactly," Sterno smirked.
The Fly frowned. "Hey, are you putting me down or something?"
"Oh, perish forbid," said Sterno sneeringly. "Far be it from
me to put you down, when you do such a wonderful job of it
yourself!"
"Oh, uh...thanks." The Fly seemed confused. He brightened.
"Say, do you suppose there'll be any beautiful harem girls in that
villa?"
Sterno looked disgusted. "This is ROME! They don't have harems
in ROME! Only the Arabs have harems!"
"Aww." The Fly seemed deeply disappointed.
A thought occurred to Ernie. "Hey, this is ancient Rome!"
"You just noticed that?" Sterno said sarcastically.
"I'll bet this has something to do with the Dead Sea
Phonograph Records!"
Sterno sighed disgustedly. "Will you PLEASE get off that Dead
Sea Phonograph Records business? You are the only person I know who
organizes their entire life around articles in sensational
tabloids! Why can't you worry about something serious, like alien
Elvis clones?"
A serious look came over Ernie's face. "Do you suppose I
should?"
Sterno sighed again. "Hopeless!"
They approached the villa. A large white marble porch, held up
by Roman columns, greeted them. Ernie noticed something moving in
the shadows nearby. 
The Fly peered at it. "Oh, it's a horse!" he exclaimed.
The horse walked towards them out of the shadows. Ernie saw it
was a good-sized palomino, well-groomed, wearing a bridle.
Something looked a bit odd about it, but in this light Ernie
couldn't tell what it was. But then, he didn't really know that
much about horses anyway.
The horse approached them."Hi there!" the horse said in a
deep, drawling voice.
Sterno started. "A talking horse!"
The horse started. "A talking dog!"
Ernie sighed. "A talking horse, right. I guess I might have
expected something like that. What next?" There was a time when all
of this would have seemed very unusual to him, perhaps even
startling. Now, however, it was getting kind of routine. 
The horse regained its composure. "Say, have any of you guys
seen my friend Wilbur around here?"
The Fly regarded the horse carefully. "You know, this horse
looks very familiar. That voice sounds familiar, too."
The horse tossed his mane. "Oh, maybe you've seen my TV show.
My name is Mr. Ed!"
"Sure!" cried the Fly gleefully. "I used to love that show!"
He began to sing. "A horse is a horse, of course, of course..."
"Will you please stop singing that stupid song?" snapped
Sterno irritatedly. "I've always hated that song!"
"You don't like the theme song?" asked Mr. Ed incredulously.
"But everybody likes the theme song! It's one of the most popular
parts of the show!"
"Well, I don't!" Sterno barked.
Mr. Ed pawed the ground. "Well, I guess that's all you can
expect from a talking dog!"
Sterno glared. "Where I come from, we grind up animals like
you and feed them to our pet humans!"
Mr. Ed whinnied. "Let's not get personal, now!"
"Hmmph!" Sterno fell silent.
"Well..." said the Fly hesitantly. "I liked the theme song!"
"Thank you," said Mr. Ed. "I'm glad somebody here has some
taste."
"Gee, it's really neat to actually meet Mr. Ed," the Fly
enthused. "You know, I always thought your voice was, like, a
special effect or something."
"A what?" asked the horse.
"You know, like dubbed or something," the Fly explained. "I
mean, I thought you weren't really talking."
"Why would you think a thing like that?" Mr. Ed wondered.
A thought occurred to Ernie. "Say, Mr. Ed," he said to the
horse. "What are you doing in ancient Rome, anyway?"
Mr. Ed tossed his mane. "You know," he said thoughtfully. "I
was just asking myself that very question!"
Ernie narrowed his eyes suspiciously. That didn't seem to be
a very satisfactory answer to him.
"Let's go inside, shall we?" suggested Sterno. "The smoke from
that burning village is bothering my sinuses."
"Good idea!" said Mr. Ed, and led the way.
They crossed the Roman-style marble porch, walked through an
open atrium with a gurgling fountain in the middle of it, and came
to a huge oak door covered with iron studs. Inside, was a 1950's
style suburban living room, complete with blond furniture and a
free-form coffee table.
Ernie frowned. "You know, somehow this looks out of place to
me."
Captain Memory sighed. "Now THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD database
is all screwed up, too. Somebody's teacher's gonna be really mad
about this!"
Ernie continued to frown. "You notice that we come across an
awful lot of fifties-type stuff? How come we don't get forties
stuff, or seventies stuff? How come it's always fifties stuff?"
Captain Memory sighed, and dropped heavily into the green
fifties-style sofa. "Oh, I'm sure there's a logical explanation for
it. I just can't think of it at the moment."
Mr. Ed pawed the ground nervously. "Say, you're not suspicious
or anything, are you? There's nothing to be suspicious of!
Everything's perfectly safe!" Somehow, this reassurance failed to
make Ernie feel any better.
Mr. Ed pointed his muzzle towards a large, floor model,
fifties-style television set. "Say, you wanna watch some TV?"
"NO!" Ernie was not ready to cope with any more TV.
Mr. Ed seemed taken aback. "You don't have to shout," he said
in a hurt tone, clopping off to the other side of the room.
"Aww, now you hurt his feelings!" said the Fly accusingly. He
set off to try to console Mr. Ed.
Captain Memory was pulling some objects out of hidden pockets
in his costume. "Ah, here it is!" he said, producing his favorite
item, the TV Guide.
Ernie felt his stomach grumbling. He was getting really
hungry by now. He hadn't gotten anything to eat back at the
gingerbread cottage, when the others were stuffing their faces. He
was beginning to really regret that now. He noticed an open door at
the other end of the living room, and decided to go and investigate
it.
Through the door was a typical suburban kitchen. His eyes
immediately fixed on one object: the refrigerator. He threw it open
excitedly. Unfortunately, it was empty, except for a box of baking
soda. Maybe there would be something in the freezer? Ernie opened
the freezer door, and started back in horror. There, frozen into
immobility, was the most hideous, disgusting, totally alien
monstrosity that Ernie had ever seen. One of it's tentacles, or
pseudopods, or whatever they were, was frozen into the ice cube
tray. Another seemed to be reaching for a box of popsicles. Ernie's
stomach turned over, and he slammed the freezer door in disgust.
Ernie ran back into the living room. "There's the most awful
thing in the freezer!" he exclaimed excitedly.
"Oh yeah?" Captain Memory wasn't actually paying attention.
"Yeah!" Ernie went on agitatedly. "It's some kind of weird,
alien thing, and it's frozen into the ice cube tray!"
"Oh, yes," Sterno commented calmly. "Aliens in the ice cube
trays. We get them all the time. Rather a nuisance. Unsanitary,
don't you know."
"What?!"
"Must you always shout?" Sterno said reprovingly. "I have very
delicate hearing, you know."
"Oh, um, sorry," Ernie was embarrassed. Apparently no-one
seemed to consider the alien very important.
Sterno thought a moment. "Were there, by any chance, some
popsicles in that refrigerator?"
Ernie was surprised. "Uh, yeah, there were. How did you know
that?"
"Oh, yes," Sterno continued. "They're always found with
popsicles, you know. That's why they come to Earth, we believe. To
steal popsicles. But then, they accidentally step into the ice cube
tray in the "Quick Chill" section, and get frozen stiff."
"Wasn't that a movie?" the Fly chimed in, momentarily breaking
off his conversation with Mr. Ed.
The word "movie" caught Captain Memory's attention. "Oh yeah?"
"Sure," the Fly went on enthusiastically. "I remember that
now. `THE THING'! It was a '50's science fiction movie about this
alien frozen into the ice at the North Pole."
"Great movie!" Captain Memory agreed. "With James Arness as
the Thing!"
"I thought James Arness was Marshall Matt Dillon on
`Gunsmoke'," said the Fly, puzzled.
"Mmm hmm," Captain Memory agreed. "But he was also the alien."
"Imagine that!" the Fly shook his head wonderingly. "Marshall
Matt Dillon was an alien! No wonder he was so quick on the draw!"
Ernie fidgeted anxiously. "So, what should I do about it?"
"About what?" Sterno asked, only half paying attention.
"The ALIEN!" Ernie cried.
"Please!" winced Sterno, putting his paws over his ears.
"Oh. Sorry." Ernie lowered his voice.
"That's better," Sterno lowered his paws. "Just don't thaw it
out."
"Leave it?"
"DON'T thaw it out!" Sterno repeated emphatically.
Ernie considered this. "Why would aliens steal popsicles?" he
wondered.
"Because they haven't any money, I suppose," Sterno mused.
"They can't buy them if they haven't any money, now can they? I
suppose they'll just have to steal them, then!"
"Uh..." Ernie felt unsatisfied by this line of reasoning.
"They can't very well just go out and get jobs, now can they?"
Sterno continued. "After all, who'd hire an alien? McDonalds? Would
you really want to buy a hamburger from an alien?"
Ernie thought about the frozen alien, and his stomach flipped
over again. "Um, no..."
"Well, that proves it, then!" Sterno leaned back triumphantly.
Ernie sighed, and sat down on the sofa. The others all seemed
absorbed in their own pursuits. Ernie fidgeted uncomfortably. His
stomach growled. He was beginning to get ravenously hungry. He
looked at the kitchen door. Maybe he could try the kitchen one more
time.
The kitchen looked a lot like something out of a 1950's
`Better Homes & Gardens' magazine. It was painted in cheerful
colors, with cast-iron trivets hanging on the walls as decorations.
Ernie would have found it quite homey, if he hadn't known that
there was a Thing in the freezer. Avoiding the refrigerator, he
walked over to a row of cabinets and began rummaging through them.
The contents of the cabinets turned out to be disappointing.
There were none of Ernie's favorite foods. He looked through the
containers. `Hearts of Toad'? No. `Poisonberry Yogurt?' I don't
think so. What's this? Ernie grabbed a box of what appeared to be
peanut brittle. `Great!' he thought. `I love peanut brittle!' He
was just about to tear into it, when he noticed the label:
`Cockroach Crunch'. He put it back gingerly. He decided that
perhaps he wasn't all that hungry after all.
Ernie was just about to give up and go back into the living
room, when he noticed a familiar-looking object on the counter
nearby. He looked at it more closely. It seemed to be an old
1950's-style coffee maker. It seemed to Ernie that he could sure
use a cup of coffee right now.He examined it more closely. `Hey!
This is Bakelite! Genuine Bakelite! This must be one of the first
coffee makers ever made! What a treasure! Plastic collectors would
pay a fortune for this!' He picked it up and carried it into the
living room.
"Hey, guys!" Ernie announced. "Look what I found!"
Captain Memory started as he saw what Ernie was carrying.
"Wow! Where'd you get that?"
Ernie was excited. "It was just sitting on the counter in the
kitchen!"
"Do you know what that is?" Captain Memory enthused. "That's
a Psion Megaforce Generator! I wonder what it's doing on this
planet?"
Ernie's heart sank. "Does this mean I'm not going to get a cup
of coffee?"
Captain Memory continued to enthuse. "Wow! A Psion Megaforce
Generator! Right here! Right in our own living room!"
Sterno, who, up to this point had not been paying any
attention, looked up irritatedly. "What? What kind of nonsense are
you going on about now?"
"It's a Psion Megaforce Generator! I can't believe it!" The
Captain seemed really enraptured by it.
"I just can't tell you how thrilled I am about that," Sterno
yawned. "Or rather, I could, but I'd rather not be impolite. So,
instead, why don't you just tell us what this thing is supposed to
be?"
"It's a Psion Megaforce Generator!" The Captain was, indeed,
very excited.
Sterno sighed. "Okay. We understand that. Now, why don't you
just calm down, and tell us what it's supposed to do."
Captain Memory seemed taken aback. "Do?"
Sterno spoke each word slowly and carefully, as though talking
to a small child. "What is it supposed to do?"
Captain Memory shifted uncomfortably. "Hmmm, lemme think. Uh,
I used to know that. I used to know all that stuff..."
Sterno repeated himself, speaking even more slowly and
carefully, as though to someone who did not speak English very
well. "What is it supposed to do?"
Ernie examined the device. He turned to Captain Memory. "Are
you sure this thing is really a Psion Megaforce Generator?"
"Oh, absolutely!" The Captain looked very relieved that
someone had broken the awkward silence.
"Then how come it says `Mr. Coffee' on it?"
"It's a `Mr. Coffee' brand Psion Megaforce Generator. What's
wrong with that?" the Captain wanted to know.
Ernie was becoming more and more skeptical. "So, how come it
says `makes 1-4 cups. Drip grind only'?"
"Well, uh, I'm sure there's a logical explanation for that,"
Captain Memory said evasively. "I just can't quite think of it at
the moment."
Ernie narrowed his eyes suspiciously. "Are you sure this isn't
a coffee maker?"
"Uh..." Captain Memory stopped. Suddenly, his eyes lit up.
"I've got it! NOW I remember! Of course, why didn't I think of it?
Now I remember what a Psion Megaforce Generator is supposed to do!"
Sterno was not impressed. "Okay. What?"
"It makes coffee!" Captain Memory cried out triumphantly.
Ernie set the coffee maker on the table and sat down on the
sofa, rubbing his head wearily. Why did everything always have to
be so complicated?
Captain Memory looked around at everyone, obviously
disappointed. Sterno was pointedly looking in another direction.
The Fly was talking to Mr. Ed. Ernie was wearily cradling his head
in his hands. No-one seemed to be greeting the Captain's
announcement with much enthusiasm.
"Of course, I could be wrong," The Captain said tentatively.
No-one answered.
Ernie began examining the coffee maker. He wasn't quite sure
how to work an old model like this. He turned it over. There seemed
to be some directions on the bottom, but the were all covered with
coffee stains, and were practically impossible to read. He would
probably just have to figure it out himself.
"Wait a minute!" The Captain said urgently.
Ernie looked up. "Now what?"
"It just occurred to me that, uh," Captain Memory looked
embarrassed. "Maybe the Psion Megaforce Generator doesn't make
coffee after all."
"So what does it do instead? Make tea?"
"Um, no." The Captain looked uncomfortable. "I think it, uh,
destroys planets."
Ernie gave the Captain a disgusted look.
"There, uh, isn't any place to put peanut butter in that
thing, is there?" the Captain asked intensely.
Ernie examined it. "No."
"Nothing about peanut butter? No little door, or compartment
or anything?"
Ernie looked it over. "Nope."
The Captain seemed relieved. "Okay, okay. Forget that. Forget
I said anything about peanut butter. I'm absolutely sure that it,
uh, destroys planets. Or makes coffee. It for sure either destroys
planets or makes coffee!" Captain Memory beamed, pleased with
himself for having solved this difficult problem.
Ernie examined the machine more closely. There was a lever on
the top which was labelled `Mild' on one side, and `Full' on the
other. He also found a two-position switch on the side. There were
little words printed next to each position. Unfortunately, the ink
had rubbed off of them, and they were very difficult to read. Ernie
peered closely. He wasn't sure, but the positions seemed to be
labelled "Brew" and "Destroy."Ernie sighed. He was rapidly losing
interest in the entire subject. Idly, he flipped the switch.
Instantly, the earth rumbled, the building shook. Ernie
hastily flipped the switch back again.
Sterno turned to Ernie irritatedly. "Who did that? Did you do
that?"
"Uh, yeah, I..."
"Well, you could at least excuse yourself!" Sterno snapped.
"Oh. Sorry." Somehow, Ernie always seemed to wind up feeling
that he was at fault.
Captain Memory was beaming. "Well, that settles that, doesn't
it? It destroys planets! I was right all along! Of course I was!"
Ernie regarded the device ruefully. He noticed a small, faded
tag on the side which read "WARNING: Follow instructions carefully.
The manufacturer assumes no responsibility for damage to planets
due to failure to follow said instructions. Such failure will also
void your warranty." Ernie sighed. "There goes my cup of coffee."
Captain Memory returned to consulting his TV Guide. An object
on the coffee table caught Ernie's attention. It was a small
rectangular object wrapped in paper. He picked it up. It seemed to
be a candy bar. Ernie's stomach started grumbling again. He was
feeling very sorry for himself at the moment. He hadn't had
anything to eat for a very long time. How come everybody else got
to eat, but not him? He couldn't even get a cup of coffee! He
unwrapped the object. It looked like a candy bar. It smelled like
a candy bar. A wave of guilt suddenly came over him. He probably
shouldn't eat it. It probably belonged to Captain Memory. But then,
on the other hand, maybe it had been on the coffee table all along,
and he just hadn't noticed it. Ernie brightened. In any case, that
sounded like a good excuse to him. He took a bite. Quite tasty,
although it did have an odd crunch. He ate the rest of the bar, and
tossed the wrapper under the sofa.
Ernie was beginning to feel somewhat better. Suddenly, the
telephone rang. Ernie looked at Captain Memory. Captain Memory
looked at Ernie. "Well?" the Captain demanded.
"Uh, the telephone's ringing," said Ernie uncomfortably.
"Are you going to answer it?" the Captain wanted to know.
"Um, you want me to answer it?"
"Well, it's on your side!" It was, indeed, sitting on an end
table right next to Ernie.
"I thought they didn't have telephones in ancient Rome," said
Ernie uneasily.
"For god's sake, answer the telephone already!" cried Sterno.
"That ringing is driving me crazy!"
Ernie picked up the phone. "Yo!" cried the voice on the other
end. "Ernie Ross, right?"
"Uh, yeah," answered Ernie uneasily. He wasn't expecting to
get any calls in ancient Rome.
"Dis is Vito. We got a little matter to discuss about
a...uh...$195,412,771,213,312,032.29, PLUS INTEREST, you know what
I mean? We're gonna get dis money, you know what I mean? So, uh,
are you gonna make it easy on yourself and give it to us now, or
are we gonna have to get it outta you, like, da hard way?"
"Well, look, I got this problem..."Ernie began desperately.
"You tink you gotta problem now," Vito interrupted. "It ain't
nothin' compared to the problem you gonna have if you don't pay
up!"
"Well..."Ernie tried again.
"Look!" Vito broke in. "I'm comin to get da money, punk, and
you better have it, OR ELSE!" He hung up.
Ernie turned to Captain Memory. "Maybe we should go someplace
else," he suggested.
"Okay," said the Captain agreeably. "Where?"
Ernie concentrated. "I know!" he said brightly. "How about we
go to the Middle East and look for the Dead Sea Phonograph
Records?"
Sterno moaned. "Not THAT again!"
The Captain looked doubtful. "It's kind of a long walk!"
Ernie frowned. "Can't you just transport us there?"
"Well, you know, I don't really like to do that too often,"
answered the Captain. "There's always a certain amount of risk.
With these locations changing all the time, there's always a chance
of a FATAL ERROR creeping in, and..."
"Okay, okay," said Ernie quickly. "Forget I said it, okay?"
"Have it your way", said the Captain agreeably.
Ernie sighed. All of this was just too much for him. "If only
we had some kind of vehicle or something. A spaceship, or even a
car!"
Captain Memory looked thoughtful. "Oh, you want a spaceship?"
"You have a SPACESHIP?" Ernie cried.
"Well, it's just a little something I take out on the
weekends," the Captain explained modestly. "It's no big deal. I
mean, it doesn't have a kitchen, or a porta-john or anything. It's
just for short hops, like around the solar system or something.
It's called the Luna C."
"Lunacy?" Sterno inquired.
"Oh, no," Captain Memory laughed. The Luna C."
"Why C?" Ernie was curious.
"Well, you know, after the Luna A and the Luna B, there's the
Luna C!" Captain Memory explained.
"So, what happened to the Luna A and the Luna B?" Sterno
wanted to know.
Captain Memory suddenly became very quiet. After a few
moments, he muttered "Well...well...it wasn't my fault!"
Ernie frowned. "What wasn't?"
"It was a stupid place to put a planet anyway!" Captain Memory
went on, suddenly indignant. "I mean, how was I supposed to know
there was a planet in that sector! Nobody would've expected a
planet to be in that sector!"
"A planet?" Ernie asked incredulously.
"Well, okay, okay," Captain Memory continued defensively.
"Maybe I was a little way out of the spacelane. It could happen to
anybody! A couple of light-years this way or that..."
"A couple of light years?" Sterno inquired.
"Okay, okay," Captain Memory seemed very ill-at-ease. "So
maybe I had a couple of drinks. Big deal! I mean, I was at a party,
right? What do you want me to do, just stand around all night?
Okay, so maybe I shouldn't have been doing Warp 9 in a Warp 3 zone.
So I made a little mistake. Big deal! I mean, what am I supposed to
do, pay for this the rest of my life, or what?"
"Let me get this straight," Sterno said. "You hit a planet at
Warp 9?"
"It was a stupid place to put a planet," Captain Memory
repeated petulantly. "It should've had a guard rail, or something."
"So what happened?" Ernie asked incredulously.
"Oh," Captain Memory looked at the ground. "I hadda pay for
it."
"You had to pay for a PLANET?"
"Well, I had insurance..." the Captain said brightly. "Um,
that is, I had insurance..." He trailed off.
Sterno caught the drift. "You don't have insurance any more?"
Captain Memory looked very uncomfortable. "Well, my premiums
kind of went up..."
Sterno thought for a moment. "You said there was a Luna A and
a Luna B. That accounts for one of them. What happened to the other
one?"
Captain Memory fidgeted. "Can't we talk about something else?"
Sterno rolled his eyes upward. "So, are you going to be flying
this spaceship?"
"Well, uh, no..." the Captain began.
"Thank Heavens!" Sterno broke in.
"I would, I mean, I could," Captain Memory continued. "Just as
soon as I get my license back..."
Sterno sighed. "So, what are we supposed to do, wait?"
"No, no," the Captain said reassuringly. "They gave me a
pilot."
Sterno breathed a sigh of relief.
"So, where isthis spaceship?" Ernie asked excitedly. He was
really looking forward to the prospect of seeing a real live
spaceship.
"I left it parked up in orbit," the Captain explained. "Want
me to call it down?"
"SURE!"
"Okay." The Captain began looking around. "Where's my remote
control? I had it here a minute ago!"
Ernie began looking around as well. "What does it look like?"
"Oh, it's about so," Captain Memory motioned with his hands to
indicated a rectangle about six inches long. "It's wrapped in white
paper."
Ernie began to feel uneasy. "What color was it? Under the
paper, that is?"
The Captain was still looking around. "It's brown, and kind of
soft." The Captain looked under the sofa. "That's funny. Here's the
paper from it, but it's all crumpled up! And the remote is gone!"
Ernie began to get a real bad feeling in the pit of his
stomach. "Um, was it, by any chance, uh, chocolate?"
"Well, sure! After all, it was either that or strawberry!" The
Captain laughed. "I couldn't very well have a strawberry remote,
could I?"
Ernie moaned quietly. "Uh, I think I know what happened to
it."
Sterno looked at Ernie, aghast. "You DIDN'T!"
Ernie nodded sadly.
Sterno turned to Captain Memory. "He ATE it!"
Captain Memory looked at Ernie incredulously. "How could you
EAT a remote control unit?"
"Well..." Ernie was embarrassed. "Actually, it was pretty
good!" Suddenly, a disturbing thought occurred to him. "Say, it's
not poison or anything, is it?"
Captain Memory looked thoughtful. "I don't know, nobody's ever
eaten one before." He thought a moment. "I guess we'll find out,
won't we?"
Ernie moaned quietly. "Well...well...If they're gonna make a
remote control unit that looks like a candy bar, they ought to put
a warning on it or something!"
"They did," Captain Memory answered.
"I didn't see any warning!" cried Ernie indignantly. "All I
saw was a piece of blank white paper!"
"That's the warning," the Captain explained. "It means `Don't
Eat this Remote Control Unit' in Franglian."
"Franglian?"
"You know, like they speak on the planet Franglia?" Captain
Memory acted as though this were perfectly obvious to everyone.
"But nobody on Earth speaks Franglian!" Ernie protested.
Captain Memory considered this. "Well, then I guess it's not
much good, is it?"He pulled out his TV Guide. "Hey, you wanna
watch some TV?"
Ernie's stomach was beginning to feel very bad indeed.
Actually, watching TV was about the last thing he wanted to do, but
considering the looks everyone was giving him at the moment, he
thought perhaps he had just better keep his mouth shut.
The Fly and Mr. Ed returned from the other side of the room.
Mr. Ed seemed to have cheered up considerably. "Hey, what's on TV?"
the Fly asked Captain Memory.
"Let me see," the Captain leafed through the pages. "Wanna
watch a movie? How about `Beach Blanket Chainsaw Massacre'? `Irate
viewers get sick of aging beach stars and cut them up with power
tools', with Frankie Avalon, Annette Funicello, Lucille Ball, and
Desi Arnaz."
"Maybe," said the Fly thoughtfully. "What else is on?"
"You like horror movies?" said the Captain. "How about
`Goldfish from Hell'? `Suburban family discovers their pet is
possessed by evil spirits', with Flipper, Lucille Ball, and Desi
Arnaz.
"Nah," said the Fly. "I don't like horror movies."
"How about `Gidget Goes Berserk'? `Gidget gets a chainsaw for
Christmas and..."
"Oh no," Sterno broke in. "I simply cannot tolerate Gidget
movies!"
"How about `Kung-Fu Tigers Go Hawaiian', with Bruce Lee,
Lucille Ball, and Desi Arnaz?"
Ernie noticed something odd about the TV listings. "Say,
doesn't it seem a little strange that Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz
are in all these different movies?"
"No, I don't think it's strange at all," drawled Mr. Ed. "Do
you?"
Sterno glared at Ernie. "After all YOU'VE done, I should think
you'd be content to sit quietly and mind your own business!"
"Hey, you'll like this!" Captain Memory said to the Fly.
"Wanna watch the `Miss Galaxy Pageant'?"
"Sure thing!" the Fly enthused. "Turn it on!"
"Okay, I'll get up and turn it on. I'll have to get up
because," The Captain glared at Ernie. "I don't have a remote!"
Ernie shrank into his seat.
The Captain turned on the television. "...and here's our
celebrity judges, Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz!" The camera panned
in to the two celebrities.
`That's odd,' thought Ernie. `They don't look the way I
remember them. I don't recall them having such pointy teeth. Oh
well, it's probably just the lighting, or something.'
"Now, our first contestant..." The girls began parading by.
Ernie noticed that the girls in this pageant didn't look quite like
the one's he was used to seeing. For one thing, they were all a lot
plumper than the beauty queens at home. None of them seemed to have
much personality, either. They all looked sort of bovine.
"Isn't she a delicious young lady," the announcer was saying.
"Look at those scrumptious legs, those mouth-watering shoulders,
those tender, juicy thighs!"
"Gee, these girls aren't very cute!" said the Fly,
disappointed. "Not like at home!"
"They look positively delicious to me!" commented Mr. Ed.
Ernie looked at Mr. Ed suspiciously. That seemed to him to be
a very strange comment to be coming from a horse. But then, come to
think of it, any comment was strange coming from a horse. 
"You wanna watch something else?" Captain Memory asked the
Fly.
"No, no, that's okay," said the Fly quickly. "I'm sure they'll
get better!"
The pageant continued. "...our next mouth-watering
contestant..." The camera cut to the celebrity judges. They seemed
to be drooling slightly. A little forked tongue seemed to dart in
and out of their mouths. Or maybe it was just a trick of the light.
Ernie felt uneasy. Beauty pageants at home weren't like this. He
decided to try not to look at it. He regarded the horse instead.
There was definitely something peculiar about that horse,
Ernie decided. It seemed to be somewhat lumpy and misshapen. There
seemed to be a line going around its middle, almost like a seam.
Why would a horse have a seam?
"...the new Miss Galaxy!" The shouts and applause drew Ernie's
attention back to the television, where the winning contestant was
being crowned. "And now.." The celebrity judges leaned forward
expectantly. Their broad grins revealed rows of needle-sharp teeth.
Their forked tongues flicked in and out of their mouths in
anticipation. "...it's CARVING TIME!" The announcer whipped out a
whirring chainsaw and advanced on the hapless Miss Galaxy, who
struggled feebly while the two runner-ups held her in place.
"Oh man!" the Fly complained. "I told you, I don't like horror
movies! They give me the creeps! Let's watch something else!" He
changed the channel.
A commercial was on the new station. A man was sitting behind
a desk, looking deadpan directly at the camera. The phone on the
desk began to ring. "Does your heart sink when the telephone
rings," the man said. "Because of bill collectors constantly
threatening you about unpaid debts?"
`Hmm,' Ernie thought. `As a matter of fact, it does."
"Why not call Acme Debt Counseling Service?" the commercial
continued. "We've helped millions avoid the nightmare of bad debts.
We'll set up a payment plan you can afford, and get those bill
collectors off your back once and for all. Call today!"
`That's an idea,' Ernie thought. `I don't know if it'll work,
but it's worth a try. Maybe they can keep Vito away long enough for
us to get out of here, at least!' He picked up the phone and dialed
the number that was displayed at the bottom of the screen.
"Acme Debt Counseling Service," a woman's voice answered.
"Yeah, I just..." Ernie began.
"Ah, Mr. Ross!" A man's voice cut in. "We've been expecting
you! I have your file right here in front of me!"
"Oh." Ernie was taken aback. How could they have known he was
going to call?
"You'll be pleased to know that we've worked out a very
convenient payment plan to take care of this matter," the man
continued. "The collection agency has agreed to accept the payment
plan, and has agreed to call off Vito, who was on his way
to...well, we'd rather not say what Vito was going to do. But
anyway, you don't need to worry about that now. Everything is all
taken care of!" Ernie heaved a sigh of relief. This collection
agency business was really beginning to bother him. They seemed to
be able to find him, no matter where in time or space he was. He
was really glad that he wasn't going to have to worry about it any
more.
"We've broken this down into small, easy-to-afford weekly
payments," the man on the phone continued. "Now, if you'll just
send in the first week's payment - in cash, of course," the man
laughed. "You can't expect us to accept a check from someone with
YOUR credit history - we'll get the ball rolling on this!"
"Um, how much is the payment?" Ernie asked hesitantly.
"Only $412,865,945.43 a week!" the main exclaimed glowingly.
"Hey, don't thank us, it's our job!"
"Uh..um..ahem," Ernie cleared his throat nervously.
The man on the phone stopped. There was an awkward silence.
"You're NOT going to tell us you don't have $412,865,945.43, are
you?"
"Uh, well..."Ernie began. "Um, I don't exactly have that much
on me, right now, that is. If you could give me a little time...a
couple of years, maybe...?"
The man on the phone sighed. "Oh, that IS unfortunate! Well,
there may still be something we can do. I'll have to talk to my
supervisor about this. Please hold!" The man's voice disappeared,
and tinny Muzak came over the receiver in it's place.
Ernie sighed. Well, he hadn't really thought that was going to
work anyway. Still, maybe they could come up with something yet. He
waited, listening to low-fidelity versions of 1950's pop hits
played by the Million and One Strings. Ernie sighed again. He hated
being left on hold.
After what seemed a very long time the man's voice reappeared.
"Good news!" he exclaimed cheerfully. "My supervisor said we may
still be able to work something out!"
Ernie breathed a sigh of relief. "Great!"
The man continued. "My supervisor says that if you don't have
the cash right now, we might be able to accept something else of
value instead."
"Like what?" Ernie couldn't imagine what he might have with
him that would be worth $412,865,945.43.
"Oh, I don't know. Just some little thing," the man said
evasively. "Like, maybe...your brain."
"MY BRAIN!" Ernie shrieked.
"Now, now, don't get excited," the man said soothingly. "After
all, what's one little brain among friends? You'll never miss it!"
"FORGET IT!" Ernie slammed down the phone.
Mr. Ed shook his head sadly. "I think you should have taken
that deal," he advised.
"Forget it! I'm not going to give them my brain!" He glared at
the horse. "What business is it of yours, anyway?"
"Hey!" The Fly interceded. "Don't pick on Mr. Ed!" He stroked
the horse. "Nice horsey!"
"Why not give them your brain?" Sterno suggested. "You never
use it!"
Ernie glared. "Leave me alone!"
Ernie looked at the TV.Black-and-white images of Lucille
Ball and Desi Arnaz were on the screen. Lucy seemed to be upset
about something. "What are we watching, anyway? More `I Love Lucy'
reruns?"
Captain Memory looked at the TV Guide. "That's funny. This is
supposed to be a movie called `Nazi Cheerleaders from Planet X'."
Ernie looked at the TV. "Oh yeah? Who's in it?"
Captain Memory consulted the TV Guide. "Let me see, uh...
Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz."
Ernie frowned. "I dunno. It looks an awful lot like `I Love
Lucy' to me." Ernie thought a moment. "Doesn't it strike you as
just a little bit odd that absolutely EVERYTHING on TV right now
has Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz in it?"
"No, I don't think that's odd at all," said Mr. Ed in his
typical, low-voiced drawl. "Why shouldn't Lucille Ball and Desi
Arnaz be in everything? They're probably the two greatest
performers who ever lived!"
"Huh?" Ernie didn't know how to answer that.
"In fact," Mr. Ed went on rapturously. "I'd say that they are
definitely the finest performers that show business has ever
produced, the greatest that ever COULD be produced, in fact, in all
of time and space, no-one, anywhere in the universe, could possibly
even approach the greatness of Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz!"
"Oh, come off it!" snapped Sterno irritatedly. "They're just
a couple of second-rate TV actors!"
"Ay, carramba!" Mr. Ed cried furiously. "What chu talkin'
about! Dey de greatest! Especialmente Desi Arnaz, de greatest Cuban
bandleader in de world!"
Ernie looked at Mr. Ed suspiciously. "Hey, what happened to
your voice? Where did you get that Cuban accent?"
Mr. Ed was flustered. "Hey man, I...uh...oh.." Something very
peculiar seemed to be happening to Mr. Ed. He seemed to be writhing
in a very un-horselike manner.
Suddenly, Mr. Ed fell in half. Both halves lay on the floor,
each writhing independently. Ernie was stunned. He stared at the
two halves of Mr. Ed, jaws open with astonishment. Suddenly, a head
covered with rolled red curls popped out of the back half of Mr.
Ed. "Oh, uh, hi guys!" It was Lucy.
Lucy turned to the front half of Mr. Ed, which was still
writhing on the floor. "Oh, Ricky! I told you to let me be the
front half of the horse! Now look what's happened!"
A voice came from the front half of Mr. Ed. "Lucy! I stuck in
dis horse suit! Help me out, okay?" The front half of Mr. Ed
thrashed wildly, filling the room with the sound of thuds and
maracas.
Lucy struggled out of her half of the horse suit, and ran over
to help Ricky. However, the more she tried to help him, the more
tangled up he got.
The Fly looked ruefully at the horse suit. "Poor Mr. Ed!"
Ernie turned to Captain Memory. "Now what?"
The Captain was still reading his TV Guide. "How about `She-
Devils of Green Gables', with Shirley Temple and..." He was
interrupted by a loud pounding on the door. "Open up!"
They all looked up, startled. The pounding came again. "Open
da door, punk! I know you're in dere!"
Lucy turned to Ricky, who was still stuck in the horse suit.
"Oh, Ricky! It's Vito! Let him in, will you? Maybe he can get our
brain from that awful Ernie person!" She glared at Ernie.
Ricky struggled in the horse outfit. "You got to get me out of
here!" He cried, distressed. "I can't see nuttin' in dis suit!"
Ernie turned to Captain Memory. "I think we ought to get out
of here, okay?"
The Captain continued to peruse his TV Guide. "Oh, you'll like
this one! `A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Attila the Hun'
with Zero Mostel and..."
Ernie paced anxiously. "Look, we've got to do something! All
these people are after my brain!"
Sterno shrugged. "Call the police!"
Ernie started. The police! That was worth a try. He grabbed
the phone, and dialed `911'.
Ernie fidgeted impatiently while the phone rang. He heard the
sound of the phone being taken off the hook. "You gotta help me..."
he began.
He stopped. The voice on the other end was a recording: "We're
sorry, all of our officers are busy at the moment. If you're being
murdered, please leave a clue, and one of our detectives will
contact your next-of-kin as soon as possible. Thank you, and have
a nice day!" Ernie slammed the phone down disgustedly.
Vito pounded on the door again. "Open up!" Ernie looked
apprehensively at Ricky, who was still struggling to get out of the
horse suit. "Look, I really think we ought to get out of here!
Like, NOW!"
Captain Memory looked up in annoyance. "Well, if you're going
to be that way about it...!" He got up and strode across the living
room, and through an open doorway which seemed to lead into the
kitchen.
"Hey, wait for me!" cried Ernie, chasing after him. As he ran,
he grabbed the Psion Megaforce Generator. He wasn't about to leave
a fortune in precious Bakelite behind! He continued to follow the
Captain. He didn't know where Captain Memory was going, but he
figured it would have to be an improvement. 
The Captain walked through the next room, which was the
typical suburban kitchen, opened a typical suburban back door, and
stepped outside. Ernie and the others followed quickly behind him.
They found themselves once again standing in a countryside of
green rolling hills. The village in the distance seemed to have
burned itself out, and only feeble wisps of smoke were rising from
it.
"I'm awfully glad we got out of there," commented Sterno. "It
was really getting dreadfully noisy! My ears are very sensitive,
you know."
The Fly was the last of the group to leave the villa. He shook
his head sadly. "Poor Mr. Ed! It must have been a real shock to
him, falling in half like that!"
Ernie considered trying to explain the situation to him, but
decided it wasn't worth the trouble. He turned to Captain Memory.
"Now what?"
Captain Memory looked around. "Nice day, isn't it?"
Ernie tapped his feet impatiently. "I think it would be a good
idea if we went someplace else! They're going to be coming after us
any minute now!"
"Not after US," Sterno corrected. "After YOU."
Ernie frowned. "Yeah. They want my brain. They don't want your
brain."
Sterno thought about this, and decided he was offended. "Well!
That just shows what those silly aliens know! If they knew anything
about brains at all, they'd realize mine is clearly superior!"
An idea occurred to Ernie. "Yeah, you're right. Maybe I should
tell them?"
Sterno frowned. "You know, I think we should go someplace
else. It's suddenly become awfully boring around here!"
"Nice day for a walk, don't you think?" said Captain Memory,
strolling off towards the yellow brick road. The others followed
quickly.

CHAPTER 7

After a few minutes walking, the four travelers through
Cyberspace began to see an encampment of some kind in the distance.
"What do you suppose that is?" Ernie wondered.
"I dunno," commented Captain Memory. "Want to turn around and
go the other way?"
Ernie thought of Lucy, Ricky, and Vito, all of whom were
somewhere behind them. "No, let's just keep going."
"It doesn't really matter which way we go," commented Sterno.
"After all, all roads lead to Rome."
Ernie thought about that. "It seems to me that would cause a
lot of traffic problems," he said reflectively.
The Fly peered into the distance. "Somebody's coming!"
Ernie started. "Uh oh, what do we do now?" He thought a
moment. "Are they Romans or Huns?"
"How should I know!" The Fly answered.
"Well, what are they wearing?"
"Funny outfits!" The Fly shrugged. "What are they supposed to
be wearing?"
Ernie sighed. "I dunno. I sort of hoped they'd be wearing
togas, or something." The men approaching were coming into Ernie's
range of vision. They seemed to be a military patrol. They wore
armor, some kind of leggings, and carried shields, bows and spears.
"So, what are they?" the Fly wanted to know. "Romans or Huns?"
"I dunno," Ernie said. "Might as well flip a coin, I guess."
"You got a coin?"
"I left all my money in my other pants pocket," Ernie
admitted. 
"So, just pick one, then," the Fly urged.
"Well, Romans then. If they're Romans, we could talk to them
in Latin. I don't know what we could do if they're Huns. What
language do they speak, Hungarian? I don't speak Hungarian."
"Do you speak Latin?" asked Sterno sarcastically.
"Well...well...I used to watch a lot of gladiator movies,"
said Ernie hopefully.
"Good enough!" said the Fly encouragingly. "You go talk to
them, then!"
"Why ME?!"
"It was your idea!" the Fly returned.
"It was NOT my idea! I never..."
"We'll just go hide in these bushes in the meantime!" The Fly
sprinted off towards a little group of bushes on the other side of
the hill, followed by Sterno and Captain Memory.
Ernie saw that the soldiers had noticed him. They were
pointing in his direction and saying something that Ernie could not
make out. Ernie decided his only course of action was to brazen it
out. He bit his lip uncertainly, and walked forward in what he
hoped would seem like a confident manner. He tried to think of
something to say in Latin. "Uh, `E Pluribus Unum'!'" he called out.
"`Gallia est divisio in partes tres!'"
They soldiers looked at him. "Hey, get a load a this!" the
first soldier said. "It's a Roman in a funny outfit!" He turned to
the soldier next to him. "Hey Frank, gimme an arrow, will ya? I
wanna shoot this guy!"
Ernie realized that he had made a serious tactical error. He
decided that the correct move at this point would be to beat a
hasty retreat. Turning abruptly, he sprinted towards the other side
of the hill, half-expecting to feel an arrow in his back at any
moment. As he ran, he could hear little bits of the soldier's
conversation drifting in his direction: "...whaddya mean, you don't
got any arrows! I told you to save some arrows! How come nobody
never does what I tell 'em?"
Ernie ran for the bunch of bushes the others were hiding in.
"What happened?" the Fly asked eagerly.
"We guessed wrong," answered Ernie glumly.
"Well, we better do something," said the Fly. "'Cause they're
coming this way!"
"I don't think they can find us in here!" said Ernie
hopefully.
"Oh, yes, they can," returned Sterno. "There's a trail of
sequins leading right to us!"
Ernie's heart sank. He knew he'd never hear the end of this.
"Oh man," said the Fly. "You better ditch that suit! It's
getting us in a lot of trouble!"
Luckily, Ernie still had his fur loincloth, sandals, and
plastic broadsword. He had been afraid to discard them, since,
after all, he had put a forty-dollar deposit on them. He quickly
changed into the Goombah the Barbarian costume, and hid the
toreador outfit under a rock.
No sooner had he finished changing then they heard a voice
coming from behind them. "Hey, what are you guys doing in those
bushes?"
The same group of soldiers Ernie had encountered on the road
was there behind them. Ernie thought fast. "Uh, we're looking for
blueberries! You guys see any blueberries around here?"
"No," answered the first soldier. "And anyway, it ain't
blueberry season, so why don't you guys come out of there, real
slow?" The soldiers held their spears in a menacing fashion.
"Sure, whatever you say," Ernie laughed nervously.
The soldiers inspected the foursome suspiciously. The first
soldier looked at Ernie. "So, what are you supposed to be?"
"Uh, I'm Goombah the Barbarian!" Ernie announced.
The first soldier guffawed. "Hey Frank, get a load a this!
This guy thinks he's a barbarian!" The other soldiers laughed
uproariously.
Ernie sulked. He didn't see what was so funny about it.
"What did he say his name was?" asked Frank. "Gumby? Gumby the
Barbarian?" The soldiers all laughed hysterically. "Lookit this -
he's got a plastic broadsword! A real tough guy!" He doubled over
with laughter.
The first soldier gradually composed himself. "Say," he said,
wiping tears of laughter from his eyes. "You didn't see a Roman in
a funny suit go by here, did you? He left a trail of sequins that
led right in here!"
Ernie thought fast, again. "Uh, as a matter of fact, yeah. He
went thataway." Ernie pointed down the road.
The soldiers looked in that direction. "Aw, we might as well
forget it. We'll never get him now!" The second soldier looked at
Ernie. "So, what are we gonna do with Gumby here?" At the mention
of the name `Gumby', the soldiers all started laughing hysterically
again. 
"`Gumby the Barbarian', huh?" the first soldier commented,
after he had stopped laughing to the point that he could speak
again. "Well, I'm Joe the Hun," he said, introducing himself. "This
here's Frank the Hun, and back there, that's Pete the Hun." He
looked at the foursome. "What a weird bunch! I guess we'd better
take all you guys to the boss!"
"Who's the boss?" asked Ernie. 
"Attila the Hun!" answered Joe.
`That figures', Ernie thought. Ernie decided that maybe he
would go along and meet Attila the Hun, especially since he
couldn't see any alternative at the moment. The foursome headed off
down the road in the direction of the burning village, escorted by
the Hun soldiers.
After a few minutes walk they entered the encampment of the
Huns. The soldiers led them to a large tent, where they were
ushered into the presence of an imposing figure. A large, heavily
muscled man in armor sat or a golden throne, leaning on a huge
broadsword. "Attila, King of the Huns!" a soldier announced.
Attila regarded the foursome carefully. "Why have you brought
these creatures before me?" he demanded in a thunderous voice.
"Uh, well sir," said Joe the Hun timidly. "We didn't know what
else to do with them." He started to giggle. "This one," he pointed
at Ernie. "He says his name's Gumby the Barbarian!" He put his hand
over his mouth to stifle his laughter.
Attila regarded Ernie seriously. "Is that correct?" he
demanded sternly.
"Uh, actually it's `Goombah'" Ernie said timorously.
Attila erupted in thunderous laughter. "That's great! `Gumby
the Barbarian!' That's hysterical!" He turned to the soldiers. "You
guys dressed him up like this for a joke, right?"
"No, it's for real!" Joe protested. "We just found 'em like
this!" 
Attila doubled over with laughter. Wiping the tears from his
eyes, he turned to the Fly. "Hey, lookit this guy's mask! It's
really weird!" 
"That's not a mask!" the Fly was offended. "That's my face!"
Attila erupted into hysterical laughter again. "He says it's
his face! That cracks me up!" The laughter was contagious; all the
soldiers were doubled up with laughter, too.
"Hey, Gumby!" Attila chortled. "What are you gonna do with
that plastic broadsword? You gonna loot, pillage and rape?"
"Well, uh," Ernie stammered. "I'm, uh, not exactly sure how to
do that. Besides, uh, don't you need a license for that, or
something?"
Attila broke up again. "`License to loot'! I love it! These
guys are hysterical!"
Sterno was getting annoyed. "This IS getting a bit tedious!"
he complained.
Attila's jaw dropped. "Wow! A talking dog! What a great act!
I get it now, you guys are traveling clowns, right? You're part of
a circus, right?"
Captain Memory looked perturbed. He seemed to be sensitive
about being called a clown. "Is that an insult?"
Attila collapsed in laughter again. "`Is that an insult?', he
says, and he says it with a straight face! You guys really crack me
up!"
The foursome shifted about uncomfortably while Attila buried
his face in his arms, laughing uncontrollably. After what seemed to
be a very long time, Attila looked up, tears of laughter still
streaming down his face. "Say, you guys are just great! We've been
doing so much raping, looting, and pillaging that it's just not
that much fun anymore! What I really need these days is a good
laugh! I feel a lot better now!" He thought a moment. "I think I'll
give you guys a reward!" He turned to Ernie. "How about a bag of
gold? Would you like that?" 
Ernie considered that. "Yeah, I guess that would be nice. I
owe kind of a lot of money right now, and I've been having a lot of
problem with bill collectors."
Attila chuckled. "Yeah, I had a lot of trouble with bill
collectors, too. But I solved that problem. Wanna know how?"
"Yeah!" Ernie was excited. Maybe he could use this solution
for his bill-paying problems.
Attila chuckled. "I chopped their heads off! You should have
seen their faces!" He thought a moment. "In fact, I think I still
have them around here somewhere. Wanna see 'em?"
Ernie grimaced. "No that's okay. I'm not supposed to look at
severed heads. It makes my stomach hurt."
At this, Attila collapsed into helpless laughter again. "You
guys are just a laugh a minute! Just when I think I've heard it
all, you come up with another one!" 
Ernie frowned. None of this seemed very funny to him at all.
"You Huns really have a strange sense of humor."
Attila's brow furled. "We do, huh?" he said menacingly.
Sterno and the Fly turned to look at Ernie. Ernie shuffled
uncomfortably. It occurred to him that maybe he shouldn't have said
that. 
A broad grin appeared across Attila's face. "That's funny! I
like it!" Ernie heaved a sigh of relief.
Suddenly, a messenger ran up to the King of the Huns. "Your
magnificence, we found these strangers lurking around the edge of
the camp!" 
Ernie looked behind him. Hun soldiers were dragging forth
three struggling captives. The first was someone Ernie did not
recognize -a beefy man in an ill-fitting suit. The other two were
Lucy and Desi. "Oh, Vito!" Lucy said to the beefy man. "Make them
let us go!"
"Oh my gosh!" said Ernie involuntarily.
Attila looked at Ernie sternly. "Do you know these people?"
"Uh, sort of," Ernie admitted. "They're, uh, bill collectors!"
Attila's face lit up. "Bill collectors! My favorite! Oh, what
fun! Let's see," he paused reflectively. "Shall we boil them in
oil, or flay them alive? Maybe we could boil them until they're
tender, and then flay them? Or maybe..." He strode off to examine
his new captives, leaving Ernie and the other alone. 
"Looks like you've solved the bill collector problem," Sterno
said to Ernie.
"Uh, yeah, I guess so," decided Ernie. "So, why don't we get
out of here before Attila decides to do something like that to us,
too?"
"Oh, he wouldn't do that," the Fly said. "Attila likes us!"
Ernie watched as Attila fingered Lucy's red curls. Lucy bit
him. Attila drew his sword.
Ernie decided he didn't want to watch what came next. "Just
the same, let's go, okay?"
"What's the matter?" said Sterno tauntingly. "Don't you want
to see what Attila's going to do to them?"
"Uh, I'd just as soon not, all right? Let's just go, okay?
Sterno continued to look back. "Looks like Lucy's losing her
head over Attila," he said, smirking. Ernie's stomach turned over
again. He hadn't really felt very good ever since eating that
remote control unit; he was sure he didn't want to see anything
that might make him feel worse.
Attila strode back to his throne, his huge broadsword
dripping bright red blood. "Gee, that was fun!" He sighed. "Well,
I guess I gotta get back to business. Who am I supposed to see
next?"
"Three representatives of the King of the Parthians, your
majesty," an attendant told him.
"Oh yeah? What are their names?"
"Larry, Moe, and Curly," the attendant answered.
Attila thought a moment. "Are they funny?"
"I believe so, sire."
"Well then, let's see 'em!" With that, the foursome found
themselves ushered out of the tent.
The four of them stood outside Attila's tent. "Well, now
what?" The Fly wanted to know.
"That's a good question," Captain Memory began. "Yes sir,
that..."
"Okay, okay," Ernie cut him off. He didn't want to hear that
whole thing all over again. "Let's just get out of here, okay?
Everybody keeps pointing at us and laughing!" Sure enough, as they
looked around, they noticed the passing Huns all pointing the
foursome out to each other and making what Ernie was sure were
snide comments. Ernie in particular was getting very sensitive
about snide comments made at his expense. "Let's go, guys, okay?"
he urged.
They began walking down the yellow brick road, heading out of
the Hun's camp. 
Soon they were out of the camp, and heading once again across
the green hills. The road rolled on before them, over hill and
dale, heading towards Rome - maybe.
The road seemed to stretch on endlessly in front of them.
Ernie sighed. It looked like it was going to be a long walk.
After what seemed to be a very long time they noticed
something up ahead of them. It seemed to be a huge cloud of dust
heading across the countryside. Whatever it was, it was going to
cross the road a short distance in front of them.
Ernie strained his eyes. "Can you make out what that is?" he
said to the Fly.
"Oh wow," said the Fly. "It's a cattle drive!"
"Don't be ridiculous!" snapped Sterno. "Cattle can't drive!"
"No, no," the Fly protested. "It's cows! A whole bunch of
cows!"
"`Herd' of cows," Ernie corrected.
"Of course I've heard of cows!" snapped Sterno. "Don't be
insulting!"
"Well, they're coming this way," the Fly said.
As the four walked along, they began to make out more clearly
a vast number of cattle, raising a huge cloud of dust with their
hooves. "What are all these cattle doing here?" Ernie wondered.
As if in answer to that question, a lone figure on a horse
came galloping toward them.
"Hey, it's a cowboy!" the Fly said cheerfully. "Hiya, cowboy!"
He waved.
The cowboy galloped up to them and stopped. "Howdy! Any of you
boys know the way to Abilene?"
Ernie looked around. "Uh, sorry. I'm a stranger here myself."
The cowboy scratched his head. "This country don't look at all
familiar! We ain't seen a thing we recognize fer quite a spell,
now. Y'all know where this here road leads?"
Ernie thought a moment. "Uh, I think it leads to Rome, but I'm
not sure."
The cowboy considered that. "Rome? Is that in Kansas?"
"I don't think so," Ernie said. 
The cowboy stroked his horse's muzzle. "Well, Toto," he said
to his horse. "I don't think we're in Kansas anymore!" He turned
back to Ernie. "Well, thank ya'll kindly!" he said, tipping his
hat. He galloped back to rejoin the herd.
Ernie turned to Captain Memory. "What do you make of that?"
"Tsk, tsk," the Captain shook his head. "The file corruption
is getting really severe. More and more data is turning up in the
wrong sector. I really don't know if the system is going to be able
to stand much more of this!"
Ernie found this comment disturbing. "Why? What'll happen
then?"
The Captain shook his head sadly. "Well...well, it might..."
He trailed off.
Ernie hated it when people trailed off. It always made him
terribly uneasy. "It might...what?" he prompted.
Captain Memory looked uncomfortable. "Are you sure you want to
know?"
Ernie thought about this for a moment, and decided the Captain
was right: he didn't want to know. 
The Fly, however, had become interested in the subject. "Oh,
I get it, we're supposed to guess, right?" he said brightly. "First
syllable? Sounds like?" He began gesticulating in a peculiar way,
as though trying to act out some unknown word. "This is fun!"
Sterno grimaced. "Will you please stop making those disgusting
motions? I can't even begin to tell you how utterly offensive they
look!"
The Fly paid no attention. "I know, I know, it's a movie star,
right?" He began prancing about in a very disconcerting manner. "Is
it a dancer, huh? A dancer?"
"Well, no..." Captain Memory looked very uncomfortable.
"I know! I know!" The Fly jumped up and down excitedly. "It's
Fred Astaire, right? Fred Astaire?"
"Uh, no..." Captain Memory shifted about awkwardly.
"Gene Kelly!" The Fly shouted excitedly. "It's Gene Kelly,
right?"
"Uh-uh." The Captain looked at the ground.
"For heaven sake's, tell him already!" snapped Sterno.
"Nothing else is going to shut him up!"
Ernie winced. He really didn't want to hear this. If it was
bad enough for Captain Memory to warn him about, it must be really
terrible. Especially considering all the terrible things the
Captain had told him WITHOUT warning him. He shuddered. No, he
definitely didn't want to hear this.
Captain Memory looked very unhappy. "It's...uh..."
"I know! I know!" The Fly was totally involved with the game.
"Carmen Miranda! It's Carmen Miranda, right?"
Captain Memory sighed. "It's...well, it's...TOTAL SYSTEM
FAILURE!"
The Fly was totally taken aback. "Huh? Sister Failure? Who's
she?" He sulked. "It's not fair to use people who aren't famous!
How am I supposed to guess that? What movies has she been in,
anyway?"
Ernie sighed with relief. System Failure. Well, that wasn't
that bad! He frowned. It suddenly occurred to him that he might
feel differently if he had any idea what a `system failure' was.
"What..." he started to say, then stopped. On second thought,
perhaps he'd rather not know.
"What in the world is a `total system failure' supposed to
be?" Sterno demanded irritatedly.
Captain Memory sighed. "That's when you totally exceed the
operating parameters of the system, to the point where not even the
multiple-redundant neural-net backups can compensate for it any
more."
"Huh?" Ernie wasn't following that.
"Well," Captain Memory simplified. "It's sort of like the
system has a heart attack."
Ernie thought about that. "And, if the system has a heart
attack..."
"Then WE have a heart attack," Sterno finished for him.
Ernie moaned quietly. He'd had a feeling it was going to be
something like this. Why did they have to tell him this, anyway?
What was he, Ernie, supposed to do about it? What did they have to
tell him if there wasn't anything he could do about it? His stomach
hurt. He decided to try to think about something else.
Their path was now blocked by the herd, forcing the foursome
to cool their heels and wait for the animals to pass. They waited
while thousands of cattle went by, raising a huge cloud of choking
dust. Finally, the herd passed and the four continued on their way.
They walked for what once again seemed a very long time,
finding nothing. Finally, the Fly noticed something. "Seems to be
something going on up ahead," he commented. "Looks like a chariot
pulled over by the side of the road."
As the foursome approached, they could see that it indeed was
a chariot. Four Romans in togas stood around it. A tire on one of
the wheels seemed to have gone flat, and they were pumping it up
with a hand pump. Ernie frowned. "Are chariots supposed to have
tires?" 
The Fly looked at the chariot. "Hey, it's got old-fashioned
skinny tires on spoked wheels, like a Model T Ford. What do you
expect?"
"I dunno." Ernie was trying hard to remember what the
chariots looked like in the gladiator movies, however he hadn't
been paying attention that closely. "With all the stuff that's been
happening, you can't be too careful!"
"Don't be such a worry wart!" snapped Sterno. "Suppose it IS
a phony chariot, what difference does it make?"
"Uh..." Ernie hadn't thought that far ahead. His thoughts were
interrupted by one of the Romans who approached them. He was a
tall, thin man, wearing a toga. He seemed like a typical Roman out
of a gladiator movie, except for the fact that he wore a monocle
and jackboots.
The man's arm swept out in a Roman salute. "Heil...I mean,
Hail!" he said cheerfully. Ernie frowned. Weren't Romans supposed
to wear sandals?
The man continued. "Ve chust finished fixing our chariot.
Perhaps you vould like a ride, ja?"
"You bet!" said the Fly enthusiastically. "Boy, I'm really
sick of walking!"
"Well, I dunno..." said Ernie. Something about this just
didn't seem right to him. He looked at the two white horses that
the chariot was hitched to, carefully examining them for any sign
of seams or lumpiness. No, they looked okay. Perfectly formed, with
no seams. One thing did seem odd about them, though: they didn't
move at all. They stood absolutely still, like statues. But then,
on the other hand, Ernie didn't really know that much about horses.
Maybe they were supposed to stand like that. It probably didn't
mean anything.
"Oh, come ON!" said Sterno impatiently. "Quit making such an
issue about everything! Let's just get in, all right? I've had it
with walking!"
"I bet you must be dog tired, right?" said the Fly.
"Spare me your attempts at humor, you insectile moron!" Sterno
barked.
The Fly looked upset. "What did he mean by that?" he said to
Ernie.
"Time to go!" urged the Roman. "All aboard, ja?"
Sterno and the Fly quickly scrambled aboard the chariot, which
seemed unusually large and spacious to Ernie. He got on as well, in
spite of his misgivings. Captain Memory brought up the rear. The
other three Romans then got on behind them, blocking the entrance
and making any escape impossible. Ernie felt very uneasy about
that. He was, however, relieved to see that Captain Memory did not
seem the least bit bothered by the situation. But then, Captain
Memory didn't seem the least bit bothered by ANY situation.
"Vell, avay we go!" said the Roman cheerfully. "Giddap!" He
snapped the reins.
Nothing happened. The horses stood there, totally immobile.
The Roman laughed nervously. "Giddy UP!" He lashed the horses with
the reins. Still nothing. From somewhere in his toga he produced a
riding crop, and began lashing the horses unmercifully. "You vill
MOVE, you shtupid animals!" The horses stood absolutely still,
totally unresponsive.
The Roman turned to the foursome with a nervous laugh. "A
liddle problem, nothing to vorry about! No need to get out!" He
jumped over the side of the chariot, and approached the horses
menacingly.
"Uh, Herr Sturmbannfuhrer," one of the other Romans spoke up.
"There is something ve forgot to tell you..."
The first Roman gave the closest horse a swift kick in the
hind leg. The leg broke neatly off. The Roman jumped frantically
out of the way as the horse toppled slowly over and crashed to the
pavement, shattering into a million pieces.
The first Roman turned on the other Romans in a fury.
"Idiots!" he shrieked. "You brought ze plaster horses! I told you,
ve must have ze REAL horses!"
"But, but Herr Sturmbannfuhrer," the second Roman sputtered.
"Ze real horses, zey make doo-doo on ze floor!"
"Dummkopf!" shrieked the first Roman. "How can ve travel vith
plaster horses?"
The other three Roman looked at each other in dismay. "Oh. Ve
didn't tink of dat."
"Idiots!" The first Roman lashed the others with his riding
crop.
"Oh man!" said the Fly sadly. "Does this mean we're gonna have
to walk after all?"
The first Roman stopped abruptly, and turned to the foursome
with a bright smile. "Oh no, of course not! Dis is chust a minor
problem, ve fix in chust a moment!" The Roman pulled some sort of
small electronic device out of his toga, and scanned the
surrounding area with it. It beeped. "Ah! Ze solution to our
problem is coming right down ze road!"
An object appeared over the horizon, moving quickly down the
road in their direction. As it approached, Ernie could see that it
was a large chariot, pulled by four beautiful white horses. It
looked somehow familiar.
The four Romans stood in the middle of the road, blocking the
path as the chariot aproached. The man in the chariot stopped,
confused.
"You!" the first Roman shouted. "Out of ze chariot! NOW!" He
pulled an evil-looking weapon out of his toga, and pointed it at
the man in the chariot menacingly.
"Make way! Make way!" the man in the chariot cried out. "I 
have no time to waste! I'm on my way to the chariot races in Rome!"
The man in the chariot looked very familiar to Ernie. Could it
be...Charlton Heston?
"I have no time to vaste, either!" The first Roman fired his
weapon at the man in the chariot, who vanished in a flash of flame.
"Now," he turned to Ernie and the others. "Ve vill take ZIS
chariot, ja?"
"Oh man!" said the Fly mournfully. "They're ruining all my
favorite shows! First Mr. Ed falls apart, and now they disintegrate
Ben-Hur!"
Even Sterno was now beginning to get suspicious. "Say," he
said to the first Roman. "What's your name, anyway?"
"My name?" the first Roman seemed nonplussed. "You vant to
know my name?"
"Yeah!" Ernie picked the question up. "What's your name?"
The first Roman laughed nervously. He elbowed the second Roman
sharply. "Quick!" he whispered. "Vot's my name?!" The second Roman
whispered something to him. The first Roman smiled agreeably. "Oh
yes, my name! I am Marcus Provolonicus."
Sterno froze in horror. "Provolone...It's CHEESE! Oh my god,
it's CHEESE! Run!"
The other three Romans suddenly whipped out evil-looking
weapons. "DO NOT MOVE!" shrieked the first Roman. "Or you vill
suffer ze same fate as our friend here!" He gestured towards the
other chariot, which now contained only a little pile of ashes.
The first Roman tore off his toga, revealing a Nazi SS uniform
underneath. "So, our liddle subterfuge does not fool you, eh?" he
said menacingly. "Dat is most...unfortunate. For vhich..." He
looked around quickly. His eyes came to rest on the second Roman.
"...YOU vill pay, dummkopf!" He lashed the man with his riding
crop.
"But, Herr Sturmbannfuhrer..." the man began.
"SILENCE!" shrieked von Liederkranz. "It is impossible to get
good help zese days!" he sulked. "Ze quality of ze Cyberslaves is
not vhat it used to be!"
He turned to Ernie and the others. "Now, you vill get on zis
chariot, and ve vill be on our vay!" Ernie looked at von
Liederkranz's evil-looking weapons, and decided to do it the Nazi's
way. They boarded the other chariot. This time, the horses worked,
and they moved off quickly down the road.
"Hey, this sure beats walking!" said the Fly cheerfully, as
they thundered along the yellow brick road.
"I dunno," said Ernie ruefully. "Considering where we're
going, maybe we'd rather walk." Ernie frowned. "Say," he said to
von Liederkranz. "Where ARE we going, anyway?"
Von Liederkranz smiled evilly. "You'll find out soon enough!"
Ernie looked on ahead. They appeared to be approaching
something. "Oh, it's a town!" said the Fly.
"Vot!" von Liederkranz snapped. "Dere's not supposed to be a
town here! Whoa!" He stopped the chariot. "Vhere's my map?" He
pulled out a map and began regarding it carefully. "Ah, here's de
problem! Ve get on ze autobahn, und turn left at Heidelberg..."
The other Romans had removed their togas as well, and stood
revealed as Nazi SS troopers. One of them peered over von
Liederkranz's shoulder. "Uh, Herr Sturmbannfuhrer," he began
tentatively. "Dat's a map of Bavaria!"
Von Liederkranz started. He looked at the legend of the map,
and then crumpled it up angrily and threw it on the ground. "I know
dat!" he snapped. "I vas chust...testing you. Very good!" He
prodded the SS trooper with his riding crop. "Okay, Mr. Know-it-
all, vhere do ve go now?"
The trooper regarded the road carefully. "Vell, since dere's
only one road, and dis isn't de right vay, I vould say ve go...de
other way!"
Von Liederkranz thought a minute. "Uh...right! De other vay!
Ve go de other vay!" He wheeled the chariot around and they
galloped off in the other direction.
They charged on down the yellow brick road in the direction
from which they had come in the first place, moving faster this
time as von Liederkranz whipped the horses bad-temperedly. After
some time, they began to approach what seemed to be a town.
"Oh wow," said the Fly. "It's the same town! How did we get to
the same place when we went the opposite direction?"
"I told you so," smirked Sterno. "`All Roads Lead to Rome'.
You're just going to have to go there. There's just no getting out
of it."
Von Liederkranz peered ahead. "Gottverdammter! Vhere's my
map?" He pulled out another map and regarded it carefully. "Ah!
Here's ze problem! Ve chust get on I-94, turn right at
Indianapolis..."
The SS trooper looked over von Liederkranz's shoulder again.
"Uh, Herr Sturmbannfuhrer, dat's a map of Illinois!" Von
Liederkranz started. He quickly crumpled up the map and threw it on
the ground. "I know dat!" He turned to the rest of the group. "Ve
are going to zis town! Ve intended to go to zis town! It vas NOT a
mistake!" They continued down the road, and into town.
The town consisted of one unpaved road, flanked by one story
wooden buildings with broad fronts. Their names were clearly
legible on them: SALOON, GENERAL STORE, U.S. MARSHAL. The town
looked somehow familiar to Ernie.
"Oh wow!" exclaimed the Fly. "It's Dodge City!"
"That's impossible!" snorted Sterno. "You can't have `All
Roads Lead to Dodge City'! That's not right! I have a classical
education and I know!"
"Could be Abilene, I suppose," mused Ernie.
"`All Roads Lead to Abilene'?" said Sterno sarcastically. "Fat
chance!"
"You must be right," Ernie agreed. "I don't see any cattle
around. Must be Dodge City after all!"
As they passed through town, Ernie noticed a tall, thin young
man who looked at them with alarm. The young man began hurrying
towards the U.S. Marshal's office, walking with a pronounced limp.
"Mr. Dillon! Mr. Dillon! Somethin' strange comin' into town!" he
cried.
A tall, imposing man, dressed in Western attire and wearing a
U.S. Marshal badge stepped out of the marshal's office and into the
street, blocking the path of the chariot. "Hold up there, now! What
do you boys want in our town?"
"Get out of my vay!" hissed von Liederkranz. "I haff no time
for dis shtupidity!"
"Now hold on just a minute there..." the Marshal began. 
"Idiot!" snapped von Liederkranz. He turned to the SS
troopers. "Disintegrate him!" von Liederkranz and the SS troopers
reached for their evil-looking weapons.
With lightning speed, the Marshal's gun flew into his hand.
Four shots rand out, catching each of the Nazis full in the chest,
the force of the bullet hurling their bodies from the chariot.
"I seen it, Mr. Dillon!" cried Chester, the young man with the
limp. "They drew first!"
Ernie threw his hands up over his head. "Don't shoot! We're
unarmed!"
Sterno get down on all fours. "Woof!" he said emphatically.
"They don't shoot dogs, do they?"
"They were holding us prisoner!" the Fly chimed in. "They shot
Ben-Hur!"
"Ben who?" The Marshal looked confused. Just then, a woman in
an elaborate red dress ran out of the saloon. "Oh Matt! Are you all
right? I heard the shooting..."
"Don't you worry, Miss Kitty, I'm just fine," the Marshal
reassured her.
Ernie looked at the ground behind him. The bloody bodies of
von Liederkranz and the other Nazis were lying motionless in the
dust.
Ernie turned to Captain Memory. "Are they really...dead?"
"Oh yes," said Captain Memory cheerfully. "Too bad they won't
stay that way!"
"Huh?" Ernie was confused.
"Well, you know how it is in computer games," the Captain went
on. "If you get killed, you just start over again with another
life!"
"I dunno, they looked pretty dead to me!" Ernie said.
"Look again," the Captain advised.
Ernie turned. The bodies had vanished. 
"See?" the Captain said. "They've gone back to the beginning.
They'll have to start all over!"
Ernie turned back to look at the Marshal, who had been
conferring with Miss Kitty and Chester. "You boys are free to go,"
the Marshal said. "Just stay out of trouble!" He went back into his
office.
"Whew!" the Fly breathed a sigh of relief. "Boy, are we lucky
to get out of that one! You don't want to mess with Marshal
Dillon!"
Sterno stood back up and brushed himself off, trying to
recover his lost dignity. "You can put your hands down now," he
said to Ernie snappishly. "You have no idea how ridiculous you look
surrendering when there's no-one there!"
"Oh." Ernie lowered his hands. He looked around. "So, what are
we gonna do in Dodge City?"
The Fly looked at the Saloon. "Look at all those pretty girls
in there! Whaddya say we go in for a drink?"
"Well...okay." Ernie couldn't think of any reason not to.
Besides, his throat was feeling pretty dusty after that long
chariot ride.
They got out of the chariot and walked towards the saloon, the
Fly leading the way. They walked up to the doors, when suddenly
their way was blocked by a burly bartender. "Hold it right there,
boys! We don't allow no Injuns in here!"
"Huh?" The Fly was confused.
"That means you!" The bartender prodded the Fly in the chest.
"Imagine that, trying to come in here with feathers..." he gestured
toward the Fly's antenna, "...and a war mask!" He gestured towards
the Fly's face. The dance-hall girls laughed derisively.
"Hey, wait a minute!" the Fly protested. "I'm not..."
A shotgun suddenly appeared in the bartender's hands. "I said
`Git!'" he said menacingly. "NOW!"
"Okay, okay," the Fly backed off. "I'm gittin'!"
"And don't come back!" the bartender called after them.
The Fly sighed as the foursome walked back to the chariot.
"Aw, gee. I never get to have any fun!"


CHAPTER 8

The foursome walked slowly back towards Ben-Hur's chariot.
Suddenly, the lead horse reared up, whinnying loudly, and the four
horses galloped out of town as fast as they could run, the empty
chariot bouncing along behind them.
Ernie was totally taken aback by this. "Hey, they started up
all by themselves!" he said, as the cloud of dust raised by the
horse's hooves drifted over them. "Can they do that?"
"Well, obviously they can!" Sterno sneered. "And it's all your
fault!"
"MY fault!" Ernie coughed. "Why is it MY fault?"
"Because it's always your fault!" Sterno snapped. "YOU didn't
tie them up!"
"Me?" Ernie protested. "I didn't know you had to tie them up!
Can't you just, like, turn them off or something?"
Sterno rolled his eyes upward. "Hopeless!"
Captain Memory looked up at the bright afternoon sun. "Nice
day for a walk, don't you think?"
Ernie looked down the road. It seemed to stretch endlessly
through a scrubby, dusty, semi-desert landscape. It looked exactly
like the scenery he'd seen in hundreds of episodes of "Gunsmoke".
It did not look like a pleasant place for a walk. "Maybe we could
just stay here," he suggested hopefully.
Just then, Marshal Dillon stepped out of his office. "You boys
better get movin', before you get into more trouble," he said
sternly. "I want you out of town before sunset!"
Ernie sighed. "Well, okay, maybe we won't stay here, then."
The foursome started off down the road, occasionally glancing over
their shoulders to see if the Marshal was still watching them.
Unfortunately, he was.
After what seemed like hours, they approached a fork in the
road. One branch seemed to head off into the mountains, and another
into the valley. They stopped.
Ernie looked at both branches of the road. "Well, which way do
we go? The high road or the low road?"
"I know!" the Fly chimed in brightly. "You take the high road
and I'll take the low road!"
"Why?"
"Because then I'll be in Scotland afore ye!" The Fly beamed.
"Gimme a break", moaned Ernie.
"Wait a minute," Captain Memory interrupted.
"What?" Maybe the Captain could come up with something that
would get them out of this desolate landscape.
"Isn't it supposed to be `you'll take the low road and I'll
take the high road?'"
The Fly frowned. "No, I'm sure it's supposed to be `you take
the high road and I'll take the low road'!"
Captain Memory shook his head. "No, I think it's the other way
around!"
"No, it can't be!" the Fly answered. "Listen!" He started to
sing. "You'll take the high road..."
"That's enough already!" Sterno broke in. "What difference
does it make, anyway! We're not going to Scotland!"
Ernie looked around. "Okay, then where are we going?"
"Rome!" stated Sterno confidently. "`All Roads Lead to Rome!'"
Ernie regarded the landscape skeptically. "I dunno. Rome,
that's in Italy, right? This doesn't look like Italy to me. It
looks like..." He stopped.
"Like what?" Sterno demanded.
"Like...well, well...I don't know what it looks like, but it
doesn't look like Italy."
"It's pointless to argue with me," said Sterno pompously.
"Because I have a classical education and I am, therefore, always
right."
"Aren't there supposed to be, like, grapes, and pizzas, and
people playing those little accordions?" Ernie wondered. No-one
paid any attention to him.
The Fly looked down the road into the valley, and up the road
into the mountains. "Okay, so which way do we go, then?"
"It doesn't matter," said Sterno self-importantly. "`All Roads
Lead to Rome'!"
The Fly started up the road into the mountains. "You guys can
go any way you want," he called back over his shoulder. "But I'm
going this way!"
"Why?" Ernie called after him.
"'Cause then I'll be in Scotland afore ye!" The Fly laughed
and started running. "Last one there is a rotten egg!"
Ernie turned to Captain Memory and Sterno. "Well," he said at
last. "I guess we might as well follow him."
"I'll say!" Captain Memory agreed. "I wouldn't want him to be
in Scotland afore me!" The three of them turned, and began walking
up the road into the mountains.
The road headed upward at a moderate angle, making walking
somewhat difficult. They began to notice the terrain around them
changing as they walked. They seemed to be moving into a cooler,
moister environment. The desert was giving way to cool Alpine
meadows. The road narrowed into a path, threading it's way between
the growing hills. `Actually', Ernie thought. `It's kind of nice
here. Maybe taking the high road was a good idea.'
They had not seen the Fly for quite some time, but they were
fairly confident that he was just a bit out of sight ahead of them,
since they could hear someone singing "I'll take the high road..."
in the distance. Suddenly, the singing stopped.
Ernie frowned. He hoped the Fly hadn't fallen over a cliff or
something. He strained his ears. No, no singing. Suddenly, he heard
another sound. "Did you hear that?" he said to Sterno.
"Of course," said Sterno assuredly.
Ernie frowned. "What did that sound like to you?"
"I believe it was `Yodellay-he-hoo'", Sterno replied.
Ernie knitted his brow in concentration. "I've heard that
before. That reminds me of something!"
"Like what?" asked Sterno, with a slight air of sarcasm.
"Fondue, perhaps? Chocolate? Watches? `Heidi'?"
Ernie brightened. "Switzerland! We're in Switzerland!"
"Very good!" applauded Sterno. "Go to the head of the class!"
Ernie frowned again. "So, what are we doing in Switzerland?"
Captain Memory shrugged. "We seem to have wandered into
somebody's Geography program."
"So now what?"
"We go on to Rome, of course," Sterno answered confidently.
Ernie looked at the rising mountains and Alpine meadows around
them. "Are you sure we're going the right way? I mean, are we
supposed to go through Switzerland to get to Rome?"
"Of course," said Sterno with great assurance. "Don't you
remember Hannibal, taking his elephants through the Alps on his way
to Rome?"
"Hannibal!" Ernie's face lit up with recognition. "I saw that
movie! Starring Victor Mature, right?" Ernie looked at the narrow
path on which they stood, and frowned. "What are we gonna do if we
run into an elephant on this trail?"
At that moment they turned a corner, and came upon the Fly,
who was standing still, looking at something. "Hi, guys!" he said.
"Take a look at this!"
The trail at this pointed rounded a curve at the top of a
cliff. The Fly pointed over the side, into the valley below. There
was some sort of commotion going on in the valley. There seemed to
be a large crowd of some sort moving through the valley, carrying
torches.
Ernie peered into the valley. There were a lot of people, or
animals, or something, moving around, but he couldn't make out what
they were doing. "Another cattle drive?" he suggested.
"I doubt it," remarked Sterno. "Look at all those torches!"
"Must be a torch drive!" the Fly said brightly.
Sterno glared at the Fly, and muttered something
unintelligible.
"Those torches sure are pretty, aren't they?" commented
Captain Memory. "Maybe we should go down and join the party?"
Ernie could hear some kind of chanting drifting up from the
valley. He strained to hear what they were saying. It seemed to be
something like `Oom alla boom'. He frowned. Somehow, he just didn't
like the look of that crowd. "Uh, maybe we'd better not," he
countered.
Sterno agreed with him. "Maybe another time," the dog
suggested.
Captain Memory looked at the others. "You guys are no fun," he
complained. The foursome watched the commotion below for a few
minutes, and then continued along the trail.
The narrow trail wound along between huge boulders, making it
impossible to see very far ahead. The foursome passed through a
narrow opening, and found themselves facing a large, open field,
which seemed to stretch on for miles.
In the middle of this space was a large, English-style
mansion, surrounded by carefully-tended grounds. The foursome
approached it.
A low, ornamental fence surrounded the grounds. A road led
through the fence, and up to the front door. Lacking any better
ideas, the foursome walked down the road and up to the front door.
The door was massive and imposing, with a huge cast iron door
knocker in the middle. Ernie looked at Captain Memory. Captain
Memory looked at the Fly. The Fly looked at Sterno. Sterno looked
at Ernie. Ernie looked around. Everyone was looking at him. Ernie
sighed, and stepped up to the door. Tentatively, he raised the
knocker and let it drop. It made a surprisingly loud sound. Ernie
flinched.
He waited. Nothing happened. 
"Try it again," Sterno demanded. 
Ernie frowned. "Why don't you try it?" He had a bad feeling
about this place. It looked like someplace he had seen in a movie
sometime. He didn't remember what movie it was, or what happened,
but it was something bad.
"Well, obviously, I'm not tall enough to reach it," said
Sterno patronizingly. "Anyway, it's your job."
"Why is it my job?" cried Ernie indignantly. "Why is it always
my job?"
"You started it," retorted Sterno.
Ernie sighed. He knew there would be some reason why it was
his job. He always got stuck with things like this. Who knows what
kind of horrible creature would answer the door. Even if it was a
normal person, what was he supposed to say to them, anyway? Oh
well, might as well get it over with. He raised the knocker and
slammed it down several times, raising a tremendous din that no-one
in the house could have missed. They waited.
Nothing happened.
"Well, nobody's home," said Ernie lightly. "I guess we might
as well go." 
"Oh, come ON," snapped Sterno irritatedly. "Where are we
supposed to go, anyway? Try the doorknob!"
Ernie shifted the coffee maker to his other hand, and gingerly
touched the huge, cast-iron doorknob, half expecting an explosion
or an electric shock. Nothing happened. He tried to turn it. It was
very securely locked, and totally unmovable.
"Well, door's locked," said Ernie in a cheerful tone. "Might
as well go!"
"We'll find another way in!" said Sterno sternly. "Let's walk
around the building."
Ernie grimaced. The others, however, seemed content to follow
Sterno as he headed off around the corner to the left. Ernie
supposed there was no way to get out of this, so he followed as
well, bringing up the rear.
A small garden path led around the corner of the building,
through the English garden, and to a nicely-tended stone patio.
French doors led from the house to the patio.
"Just as I thought!" Sterno declared. He strode purposefully
up to the doors, and tried the knob. They were unlocked. He led the
way into the house.
They found themselves in a luxurious English-style study, the
walls panelled with dark oak, and lined with shelves containing
leather-bound books. Sterno headed immediately for a small
occasional table by the wall. "Aha!" he cried. "I knew it!" He
flipped open a dark wood box, revealing a store of excellent
cigars. He grabbed a handful of them, lighting one immediately.
"Ahhh!" He exhaled a cloud of blue smoke. His eyes lit upon a
decanter sitting next to the humidor. "Lovely!" he exclaimed.
"Brandy, anyone?"
Ernie sighed wearily. All this stress was just too much for
him, he decided. Luckily, there was a large, overstuffed Victorian
sofa placed in the middle of the room. Ernie dropped heavily onto
it, followed by Captain Memory and the Fly.
Captain Memory scanned the room slowly. "I wonder where they
keep their TV?" he said pensively.
The sofa faced to large oak doors, which Ernie supposed must
lead to the rest of the house. Ernie considered them, wondering if
they should try to explore the house further. No, he decided, let's
just leave well enough alone.
At that moment the doors flew open. In the doorway stood a
tall, very British-looking gentleman, with a white handlebar
mustache, wearing a smoking jacket and a top hat. "How good of you
to come!" he announced jovially. "I'm Lord Foofaraw. Do make
yourselves at home! Tea, anyone?" A butler entered, carrying a
silver tray full of teacups, and three large, covered, silver
dishes. Ernie gratefully accepted a cup of tea, and peeked under
the covers of the dishes. The first two contained unappetizing-
looking little ornamental sandwiches. They seemed to be made of
plastic, or some other not-entirely-edible material. At this point,
however, Ernie was so ravenously hungry he would have eaten
practically anything, even items that were only marginally edible.
However, Ernie decided to check the third dish. What luck! It
contained a large pile of fresh, hot, sizzling lamb chops, broiled
to perfection. Ernie loved lamb chops. He grabbed the entire dish
off the tray and began wolfing them down, eating them with his bare
hands.
As Ernie's hunger subsided, he began to feel self-conscious.
They seemed to be having an elegant English tea with a titled
British nobleman, and here he was wearing a fur loincloth, carrying
a plastic broadsword and a coffee maker, and eating lamb chops with
his bare hands. It didn't seem proper to Ernie. Certainly it was
very un-British. Ernie frowned. Then, on the other hand, it wasn't
his fault. Lord Foofaraw was the one who served the lamb chops.
They shouldn't serve lamb chops if they don't want people to eat
them. And anyway, they didn't give him any utensils, so he had to
eat them with his hands. That settled, Ernie returned to stuffing
his face with chops.
"Pip, pip! Cheerio! Eh, wot?" said Lord Foofaraw jovially. 
"How very British!" exclaimed Sterno delightedly.
"Rather!" agreed Lord Foofaraw.
Ernie turned to the nobleman. "I wonder if you could tell us
where we are?" he managed to ask between bites.
"Where you ARE?" Lord Foofaraw seemed amazed. "Why, I should
think that would be quite obvious! You're HERE, old boy!"
Sterno chuckled. The Fly waved his antennae confusedly.
Captain Memory continued to look around for a TV.
Lord Foofaraw settled comfortablyinto an overstuffed chair.
"Ah yes," he began. "This reminds me of the time I was lost in the
jungles of Poodawumpus, surrounded by cannibals!" He leaned forward
animatedly. "There were cannibals to the right of me, cannibals to
the left of me! The light of their torches flickered through the
dense undergrowth. I could hear their infernal chanting: `Oom alla
boom! Oom alla boom!' Over and over, until I thought the infernal
din should surely drive me mad! Suddenly, I...." He broke off,
looking at Ernie oddly. "I say, my good man, why ever are you
carrying that coffee maker?"
Ernie fidgeted uncomfortably. "It's not a coffee maker, it's
a Psion Megaforce Generator."
"A WOT?" the lord was amazed.
"A Psion Megaforce Generator!" Ernie repeated. Lord Foofaraw
looked at him skeptically. Ernie looked again at the device he was
carrying. He sighed. "On the other hand, it could be a coffee maker
too, I suppose." Ernie admitted. "Anyway, it's genuine Bakelite!"
"Ah, yes! Bakelite!" the lord seemed to consider this answer
reasonable. A faraway look came into his eyes. "That reminds me of
the time I was trekking through the desert of Duzzlebuggy..."
"But, what about the cannibals?" the Fly broke in, his
antennae waving excitedly.
"Don't interrupt His Lordship!" snapped Sterno.
Lord Foofaraw looked confused. "I say, old man, there are no
cannibals in the deserts of Duzzlebuggy!"
The Fly's antennae drooped disappointedly. "I wanted to hear
about the cannibals!"
"Oh, dear!" The lord seemed quite flustered by all these
interruptions. "Where was I? Ah, yes, there I was, scaling the
mountains of Muffiedump...."
Ernie's mind wandered. He noticed a beautiful silver bell
sitting on an end table next to him. It seemed to be a very unusual
design. It was covered with dozens of tiny pushbuttons, each with
an odd little symbol next to it. Ernie picked it up curiously.
"BONG! BONG!" Loud, synthesized bell-sounds appeared as though
out of nowhere.
Lord Foofaraw looked up in annoyance, stopping his story in
mid-sentence. "I say, my good man! Whatever ARE you doing?"
Ernie looked up disconcertedly. "I...um..it..."The bell
continued to bong loudly.
"How RUDE!" Sterno glared at Ernie.
Ernie examined the bell frantically, trying to figure out how
to turn it off. He could see now that is wasn't a real bell, but
rather an electronic, synthesized bell, with orchestral sounds, a
rhythm machine, and full MIDI capability. 
Ernie pushed the tiny buttons frenziedly, desperately trying
to turn the thing off. The sound changed. "Chick-a-Boom! Chick-a-
BOOM!" Ernie had accidentally turned on the rhythm machine.
The door to the study opened. The Butler entered, a swarthy
character who looked somehow familiar to Ernie. The sound abruptly
stopped. Ernie breathed a sigh of relief.
The Butler looked at Ernie, and then at Lord Foofaraw. "Chu
rang?" he enquired.
"Ah, yes!" Lord Foofaraw seemed to have regained his
composure. "More tea, Richard!"
"Chure!" the Butler said agreeably, and began refilling their
cups.
His Lordship resumed his story. "...and there I was,
surrounded by techno-savages! They had decided to sacrifice a
virgin, but the first one they selected was discovered to be, how
shall I say, damaged, so they were obliged to move on to the next,
who became Virgin 2.0. But she was found to be not entirely
suitable, so they settled upon Virgin 2.1, revised...."
It seemed to have gotten dark outside, although they had
hardly noticed it, since the Butler, or someone, had turned on the
lights. That was odd, Ernie thought, because it had been the middle
of the afternoon only a few minutes ago. He was going to consider
it further, when abruptly, the lights went out, plunging them all
into total darkness.
From out of nowhere, a gust of wind blew up, throwing the
French doors open violently.
Suddenly, a shot rang out. They heard a cry, and a body fell
heavily to the floor.
The lights came on again. There, in the middle of the Persian
carpet, Lord Foofaraw lay dead in a pool of blood. Nearby lay a
smoking gun. Ernie was stunned. Before he could even think of what
to do, the oak doors leading to the rest of the house flew open,
and a man in a trench coat and a fedora strode purposefully in.
"Scotland Yard!" he announced. "No-one leave this room!"
A crowd of Bobbies seemed to have materialized outside of both
sets of doors. Clearly, no-one was going to be able to leave this
room until the detective was ready to allow it.
Ernie frowned. This was beginning to remind him an awful lot
of some movie or other, although he still couldn't remember which
one it was.
"Oh, I remember this!" Captain Memory exclaimed delightedly.
"This is a game called `MYSTERY', you know, one of those who-dunnit
things? We have to solve the mystery!" The captain seemed very
pleased. "This is great fun!"
The detective scanned all of their faces carefully. "So, here
we all are, at last!" he said.
`At last?' Ernie thought. "Uh, we only just got here," Ernie
said tentatively, wiping his greasy hands on his fur loincloth.
"And we really don't know anything about this, so, if you don't
mind, we'll just be on our..." He started to get up.
"Sit DOWN!" shouted the detective. "No-one leaves until I say
so!"
Ernie sat. He hadn't really thought he was going to get away
with that, but he'd though he'd give it a try anyway.
"So," the detective continued. "We know you all had a reason
for wanting Lord Foofaraw dead!"
The foursome all looked at one another. Ernie shrugged.
Captain Memory shrugged. The Fly shrugged. Sterno shrugged, in a
very un-doglike manner.
"Well, actually," Ernie began tentatively. "No, I..."
"A likely story!" interrupted the detective. "Here you are,
wearing a fur loincloth and a plastic broadsword, carrying..." He
cocked an eye quizzically at Ernie, "...a coffee maker? And you
expect me to believe a story like that? And just WHERE did you get
that bag of gold, anyway?"
Ernie began to feel very self-conscious. He decided that
perhaps he had better keep his mouth shut. It didn't seem to him
that saying `Attila the Hun gave it to me' would go over very well.
"And what about those LAMB CHOPS?!" the detective thundered.
"Everyone knows that one never serves lamb chops for tea! So, just
what is the meaning of all this?" Ernie shrank down into his seat.
"And YOU!" The detective jabbed a finger at the Fly, who
flinched. "You blamed Lord Foofaraw for your terrible accident,
didn't you? The accident that left you horribly disfigured, and
left Lord Foofaraw free to start an affair with YOUR WIFE!" 
"But, but, I don't even have a wife!" The Fly began, his
antennae waving in consternation.
"All these years you've plotted revenge, haven't you?" the
detective continued. "And now, suddenly, mysteriously, Lord
Foofaraw turns up DEAD! What are we to make of THAT, my fine Fly
friend?"
"But, but...." The Fly's antennae waved wildly.
The detective, however, had already gone on to the next
suspect.
"And YOU!" He jabbed a finger at Sterno. "You've had no reward
for years of faithful service, have you? You've worked like a dog,
running and fetching every time his Lordship snapped his fingers.
We know how you resented it, how you longed to even the score. Yet,
year after year you let his Lordship treat you like an animal, with
never a whimper of complaint. And NOW, here you are, helping
yourself to his Lordship's best brandy and cigars! What would his
Lordship have thought of THAT!?"
Sterno thought fast. "Woof!" he answered. The detective,
however, had already gone on to the next suspect.
"And finally," the detective said, leaving a pregnant pause,
"we have YOU!" He jabbed a finger in Captain Memory's face. "The
famous Captain Memory! `Through Space and Time Without a Dime' I
think you've been heard to say!"
"Actually, I sort of prefer `Through Time and Space to a
Better Place'", answered the Captain conversationally.
"A likely story!" snapped the detective. "We know what you've
been up to! We see you when you're sleeping! We know if you're
awake! We know if you've been bad or good, so be..." He stopped
abruptly, glancing suspiciously about him. "Never mind! The
question here is: just exactly how do you JUMP out of sectors that
aren't supposed to accept any external commands, anyway?"
Captain Memory frowned. "What does that have to do with Lord
Foofaraw?"
"You know very well what it has to do with the case!" snapped
the detective. "Just answer the question!"
Suddenly, a light went on in Ernie's head. He suddenly
remembered how all the pieces fit together. "I know!" he shouted.
"The BUTLER DID IT!"
The butler blanched. "Hey, mon!" he cried out. "What chu
talkin' about? I don' do nothin'!"
The detective looked irritated. "Don't change the subject!" he
snapped. He turned back to Captain Memory. "Awright, youse guys!
Talk! Youse guys ain't gonna play me for a patsy!"
Ernie and the Fly looked at each other in confusion. 
The detective continued. "You lousy two-bit gunsels think you
can take a rod and..." One of the Bobbies came in hurriedly, tapped
the detective on the shoulder, and whispered something in his ear.
"What...?!" the detective snapped. He laughed nervously. "Oh.
Right. BRITISH detective." He laughed again. "Pip pip! Cheerio! Eh,
wot?"
Ernie frowned. There was something very suspicious about this
detective. For one thing, his large, British-style handlebar
mustache did not seem to be attached to his face very well. It was
slowly drooping off one side of his face. There was something funny
about his clothes, too. The trenchcoat was okay, the hat was
okay...Maybe it was the jackboots?
Sterno gave the detective a pitiless glare. "You lost your
character!" he accused. 
The detective laughed nervously. "Character? Vot character?
I'm not a character, I'm...uh..." He looked flustered. He elbowed
the bobby next to him. "Quick!" he whispered. "Who am I?" The bobby
whispered something in his ear. 
The detective seemed to recover his composure somewhat. "Oh,
yes! Of course! I'm the famous British detective, Thomas Cheddar!"
Sterno's fur stood on end. " Oh, no! It's cheese! CHEESE!
RUN!" he wailed.
But it was too late. The detective whipped an evil-looking
weapon out from under his raincoat, which parted to reveal a black
SS uniform beneath it. "Enough of zis shtupidity!" he cried,
holding the foursome at bay. "You vill perhaps recognize me now,"
he said confidently. He screwed a monocle into one eye, and whipped
off the false handlebar mustache with a flourish. He immediately
regretted this, and winced with pain as the glue on the false
mustache tore out half the hairs of his real mustache. He quickly
regained his composure, however, and waited for some response from
the foursome.
Captain Memory looked at Ernie. Ernie shrugged.
The detective looked from one to the other. "You DO recognize
me, ja?" he asked, a bit uncertainly.
"I'm sure we've seen you someplace before," said Sterno
patronizingly.
"Of course," agreed Captain Memory. "It's on the tip of my
tongue! It's...uh..." He trailed off.
The Fly's antennae waved uncertainly. Suddenly, he brightened.
"Oh, I get it! It's a game, right? First syllable? Sounds like?" He
began gesticulating wildly. "I know! I know! It's Fred Astaire,
right? Fred Astaire?"
"Enough!" the detective shouted angrily. "I cannot believe dat
you do not recognize me, Sturmbannfuhrer Dr. Heinz von Liederkranz,
de most famous Nazi in all Televisionland. Obviously, you haff
recognized me all along, and you are chust toying vith me. Vell,"
he smiled evilly. "Ve shall see who toys vis who!"
Sterno frowned. "Whom," he corrected.
"Vot?!" snapped von Liederkranz.
"Whom," Sterno continued. "It's not `who toys with who', it's
`who toys with whom'."
Von Liederkranz's monocle dropped out of his eye. "Was fur ein
shtupid language! I haff no time for dis! We must get on vis de
questioning!" He smiled evilly.
"Okay," said Captain Memory agreeably. "Why do fools fall in
love?"
"Nein, dummkopf!" von Liederkranz shrieked. "I ask ze
questions!"
The Fly sulked. "Why do you always get to ask the questions?
How come we never get to ask any questions?"
"Quite right!" Sterno asserted. "And why must you always wear
that dreadful uniform?"
Von Liederkranz stopped, startled. "Uniform? Vot's wrong vis
my uniform?"
"I mean, really!" Sterno sniffed. "It's hardly the thing for
High Tea, is it? I should think a top hat..."
"Puttink on a top hat?" von Liederkranz asked incredulously.
"White tie, tails..." Sterno went on.
"Puttink on a white tie?" The Nazi seemed amazed.
"PUTTING ON THE RITZ!" The Fly shouted joyously, finishing the
line of the song. "I knew it! I knew it was Fred Astaire!"
Von Liederkranz drew himself up to his full height. "Ja, I DO
look a great deal like your Fred Astaire, nein?" Of course, he
didn't look anything like Fred Astaire, but no-one wanted to be the
one to tell him that.
"Oh yes," Sterno enthused insincerely. "You've all the
elegance, all the grace of the greatest dancer of all time!"
Von Liederkranz preened. "Ja, dat's right! I do!" Looking
down, he noticed Lord Foofaraw's top hat, which had rolled off his
head when he collapsed, dead. He picked it up, tossing his own
military cap aside. Using Lord Foofaraw's top hat and his own
riding crop as a cane, he attempted to do a Fred Astaire-style top-
hat-and-cane number. He began to do a few awkward, shuffling dance
steps. "Puttink on mein top hat..." he began to sing.
The `Bobbies' had by now shed their English policeman uniforms
to reveal their Nazi uniforms beneath. Theywere totally confused
by this turn of events. They shuffled about awkwardly, not knowing
what to do.
Von Liederkranz glared at them. "Sing!" he commanded. The
Nazi's lined up and formed a chorus line, swaying with the music,
singing off key "...puttink on mein white tie..."
Von Liederkranz attempted to do some slightly more complicated
steps, but succeeded only in knocking over the silver tray, sending
the tea cups and little plastic sandwiches crashing to the ground.
This threw the other Nazi's off their rhythm. Half of them
swayed left, and half swayed right, causing them to violently bump
into each other, knocking some off their feet. Their voices trailed
off.
"Sing!" von Liederkranz commanded ferociously.
The Nazi's resumed singing with feigned enthusiasm. "PUTTINK
ON DER RITZ!!
"I knew it!" the Fly enthused. "I knew it was Fred Astaire!
That means I win, right?"
Von Liederkranz and the Nazis began dancing gracelessly
towards the door that led to the hallway, singing "Dum de dum de
dum dum...." since they couldn't remember the rest of the words. 
"Bravo!" Sterno applauded enthusiastically. "Keep it up,
you're doing great!"
Von Liederkranz grinned broadly and began dancing with greater
enthusiasm, although no better rhythm. He headed out the door and
down the hall, the Nazi chorus line crowding awkwardly behind him. 
"Fabulous!" Sterno enthused. He signalled to Ernie, the Fly,
and Captain Memory, who caught the hint and began applauding as
well. "Wonderful! Tremendous!" they all cheered.
The Nazi's voices began receding down the hall. Sterno
gestured towards the French doors leading to the outside. The four
got up, and began tiptoeing towards them.
Suddenly, the heard a resounding crash coming from down the
hall. "Dummkopf! Schweinhund!" cried a voice, followed by the snap
of a riding crop. 
"RUN!" cried Sterno. The foursome charged through the French
doors and went sprinting across the field behind the house.
In a few moments, the English Tudor mansion was out of view.
Peculiarly enough, as soon as they left the mansion it was mid-
afternoon again. The darkness seemed to have been confined to the
study. The four slowed down to a walk, exhausted and out of breath.
Ernie looked back. There was no sign of pursuit.
"Looks like they're still trying to get their act together,"
Captain Memory commented.
"That act has got, let's say, a few rough spots that need to
be ironed out," Sterno snickered. "I think they're going to be
working on it for rather a long time." 
Ernie sighed with relief. Those Nazis made him very uneasy.
The four continued walking. They were in the midst of what
seemed to be many acres of lush, grassy meadow. A short distance
ahead Ernie spotted flock of sheep peacefully grazing.
"Sheep!" Ernie exclaimed.
"Really?" Sterno asked sarcastically. "How clever of you to
figure that out!"
A small group of sheep detached themselves from the flock and
walked up to the foursome. Ernie noticed that they looked much like
the other sheep in the flock, except for the fact that they were
wearing dark sunglasses. Looking closely, he could see that some of
them seemed to be carrying some objects that looked a lot like....,
hmm, well, like surfboards. "Baa!" the first sheep said, as if in
greeting.
"Baa Baa!" Sterno replied. The sheep seemed to respond
favorably to this.
"You speak their language?" Ernie was astounded.
"Of course," Sterno replied offhandedly. "I was always a great
student of foreign languages."
"But, what language do they speak?" Ernie wanted to know.
"Sheepish, of course," Sterno replied in a patronizing tone.
"Everybody knows THAT!"
The lead sheep continued. "Baa Baa Baa!"
"Ba?" inquired Sterno.
"Baa Baa Baa!" the lead sheep repeated vigorously.
A second later, the next sheep repeated the same thing, "Baa
Baa Baa!" And then the next sheep picked up the refrain; soon they
were all chanting "Baa Baa Baa." Suddenly, the lead sheep launched
into the main verse: "Baa Baa Baa, Baa Barbara Ann...." 
"Oh, it's the Beach Sheep!" the Fly exclaimed.
By now the entire group of sheep had launched into the song,
in full chorus. "They're not bad," admitted Ernie. 
"Even the President likes the Beach Sheep," the Fly asserted.
"Of course, they're not really the Beach Sheep," Sterno
explained.
"They're not?" the Fly seemed very disappointed.
"Don't be silly!" Sterno sniggered. "You couldn't expect the
real Beach Sheep to be performing in a little, out-of-the-way
meadow like this, could you? The only play the really big fields
nowadays!"
"Aww!" The Fly's antennae drooped.
"No," continued Sterno. "They're just one of a whole flock of
Beach Sheep impersonators. A good imitation, but not the real
thing."
Ernie thought a moment. "You mean, like Elvis impersonators?" 
"The Sheepish equivalent," Sterno agreed.
Having finished their song, the Beach Sheep began discussing
something with Sterno in very serious tones. Ernie, of course,
couldn't understand a bleat of it, since it was all in Sheepish.
"So, what's the deal?" the Fly wanted to know.
"It seems the sheep have a problem," Sterno explained.
"They're being oppressed by one of their own kind, a cruel tyrant
who will stop at nothing to get his own way."
"Gee, that's tough," the Fly shook his head sadly.
"What's this tyrant called, anyway?" Ernie was curious.
Sterno paused dramatically. "They call him....the Wooly
Bully!"
Ernie frowned. That name seemed somehow familiar to him.
The Fly started snapping his fingers and humming. "Wooly
bully, wooly bully..."
"Will you STOP that!" barked Sterno. "Have some respect,
please! This is a serious problem!"
"Oh. Sorry." The Fly fell silent. 
Sterno continued conversing with the sheep. "They're asking
our help in breaking free of this awful tyranny."
"Wooly Bully, that reminds me of something." Captain Memory
became thoughtful. "The Hully Gully, perhaps?"
The Fly's antennae perked up. "The Frug? The Jerk? The Mashed
Potato?" he suggested.
"The Swim?" Sterno added. "Or even, The TWIST?"
A brilliant idea occurred to Ernie. "I know! This must be `The
Land of 1,000 Dances!'"
Sterno turned to Ernie with a look of utter disgust. "Look,
we've been through this before, remember? `Fondue, chocolate,
watches, `Heidi'', remember?"
Ernie became subdued. "You're trying to tell me this is
Switzerland, right?"
The Fly's antennae twitched excitedly. "Oh, I remember that
now! `Land of 1,000 Dances!' That was a song by Cannibal and the
Headhunters!"
"Cannibal..." Ernie started. He thought for a moment. "On the
other hand," he went on. "Switzerland is fine! Chocolate,
`Heidi'..... Fine, just fine!"
"Well!" Sterno sniffed. "I'm glad THAT'S settled!"
Captain Memory looked at his wrist. "Watches? Did you say
watches?"
Ernie looked at the sheep. He noticed that each of them wore
rather a nice Swiss watch on one of their front forelegs.
Captain Memory continued to look at his bare wrist, and
sighed. "Oh dear, I'm afraid it's getting late. We'll have to be
going!"
Ernie was nonplussed. "Aren't we supposed to, like, help them
overthrow the evil ruler, or something?"
Captain Memory shrugged. "It's not my problem, you know? I
mean, we can't do everything!"
"Baa Baa!" said the lead sheep insistently.
"The sheep wants to know," Sterno translated. "If you can't
help overthrow the Wooly Bully, could you at least give him some
clue as to the whereabouts of his daughter? She's been missing
since yesterday, and he's afraid something terrible might have
happened to her, the poor little lamb!"
Ernie burped. Everyone turned to look at him. "Uh, who, me? I
don't know anything about it! Why would I know anything about it?"
He fidgeted uncomfortably, compulsively wiping his still-greasy
hands on his fur loincloth. "Stop looking at me like that!" 
"I think we'd better get going!" said Captain Memory
decisively. "Now!"
The four turned to leave. Ernie looked back at the group of
sheep. He smiled weakly, trying to think of something nice to say
in Sheepish. "Ba!" he waved good-bye.
The lead sheep started, and rose up on his hind legs looking
very angry and offended.
"That was very rude!" Sterno reproved Ernie.
"Uh, what did I say?" asked Ernie, bewildered. "I only
meant..."
"After ALL!" Sterno continued. "You've never even met his
mother! And even if you had, I seriously doubt she would have
consented to do anything like that with YOU!"
"Gee, I'm sorry, I..." Ernie decided that perhaps the safest
thing to do was simply be quiet.
The four continued walking. Ernie noticed that it seemed to be
getting warmer. Substantially more humid, too. Even though he was
wearing only a loincloth, Ernie began to perspire. The others also
seemed to be feeling uncomfortable from the heat. All except
Captain Memory, who never seemed to be uncomfortable at all.
As the sun began to set, Ernie noticed that the vegetation
around them was different, now. The warm area they were heading
into seemed to full of tropical plants. Lush flowers and tall trees
loomed ahead of them. In fact, they seemed to heading into a
jungle. 
Ernie noticed an object lying in the grass. It appeared to be
the broken remnants of a vandalized sign of some sort. Ernie could
just barely make out a few words through the layers of graffiti.
"Pooda....something," Ernie read. "No alcoholic beverages allowed.
Do not feed the..." The rest was gone. Something about it made
Ernie feel very uncomfortable.
"Um, is it really a good idea to be heading into the jungle at
night?" Ernie asked nervously.
"Oh, you're right," said Sterno sarcastically. "Let's just
check into a Holiday Inn instead!"
"Well, it's just that it's awfully, well...dark," Ernie
fidgeted.
"It gets that way at night," Sterno pointed out. "You know of
some way to prevent it, perhaps?"
Ernie eyed the thick jungle vegetation ahead of them with
misgivings. "What if there's, um, hostile natives or something?"
At that exact moment, drums began pounding in the distance.
Ernie began to feel very uneasy. "Do we have to go in there?" he
pleaded.
"No, not at all," Captain Memory pointed out. "We can just
stay here and wait for the Nazis to catch up with us, if you like!"
Ernie moaned. "No, that's okay. Let's just keep going!"
Captain Memory shook his head sadly. "I dunno, nothing seems
to make you happy! You don't want to go, you don't want to stay...
You know, you really need to have a more positive attitude!"
"Yeah, right," Ernie grunted. They continued along the way
into the jungle. The vegetation seemed to swallow them up. The
heavy masses of green foliage on all sides seemed to offer little
possibility of escape. The continued along the trail, which became
ever narrower as they progressed.
"Look!" the Fly pointed ahead. It was now almost night. The
jungle before them was almost pitch black. However, off to the left
small points of light could be seen, weaving and bobbing in and out
of the foliage in the distance.
"What's that?" Ernie wanted to know. "Fireflies?"
"Torches!" the Fly corrected. "It's those villagers we saw in
the mountains! They've come to meet us! Isn't that nice?"
Ernie was still uneasy. "Are you sure they're friendly
villagers?"
The Fly peered into the distance. "They sure LOOK friendly! It
looks like they're having a party! They're all singing and
dancing!"
As the villagers approached, Ernie began to be able to make
out what they were singing. They were chanting rhythmically to the
beat of the drums. "Na, na na na na, na na na na,..."
Ernie frowned. "I KNOW that song! It's, um it's...."
"Sure!" the Fly broke in. "`Land of 1,000 Dances'! What a
great song!"
"AHA!" cried Ernie. "See, I told you! I was right!" He turned
to Sterno. "See? This is The Land of 1,000 Dances! I was right
after all!"
"You were not!" sniffed Sterno. "That was there, this is here!
That was Switzerland, this is the Land of 1,000 Dances!"
Ernie sulked. "Well, I was sort of right! Anyway, this is The
Land of 1,000 Dances, so those guys with the torches must be..." He
suddenly turned pale. "CANNIBAL AND THE HEADHUNTERS!!"
"Cool!" agreed the Fly. "Great band, huh?"
"What are we gonna DO!?" wailed Ernie.
Suddenly, they were distracted by a loud crashing in the
forest behind them. "Gottverdammter! Schweinhund!" The crack of a
riding crop could clearly be heard. They turned to see bright
fingers of white light, as though from high-powered flashlights,
probing through the foliage.
"Zey must be in here somevhere!" they heard a voice call out.
"Ze trail of isotope tracers from ze radioactive lamb chops leads
right zis vay!"
Ernie pressed his hands to his stomach. "I don't feel good,"
he moaned.
Ernie looked up to find the other three glaring at him. "How
was I to know the lamb chops were radioactive?" he protested
loudly. "Do you think I would have eaten them if I knew?"
"Ssh!" The four heard the voice behind them call out. "I tink
I hear zem!" Ernie quickly put a hand over his mouth.
Up ahead, the bobbing torchlights were weaving ever closer.
The pounding drums and chanting was getting louder. The chanting
had changed now. "Oom alla Boom!" Ernie could hear. "Oom alla
BOOM!" From behind, the searchlights were weaving ever more in
their direction, slowly beginning to focus in on their position.
Ernie whimpered quietly.
"Hey guys, look at this!" the Fly pointed to something in the
darkness. Off to the right, visible only to the Fly's huge insect
eyes, a faint trail split off from the main path. "Let's try this!"
The Fly hurried down the trail. The others followed as closely as
possible, so as not to get lost in the increasing darkness.
The four scampered along the dark, narrow path, attempting to
move quickly, but also quietly, and not doing a very good job of
either. The sounds of pursuit behind them seem to grow ever louder.
The trail led to a large clearing, and then stopped.
Surrounding the clearing was an impenetrable thicket of thorn
bushes. In the middle of the clearing was a large iron pot, big
enough for all four of them to fit into at the same time. It sat on
a large pile of neatly arranged firewood. A heap of neatly cut-up
potatoes and carrots lay nearby.
"I don't like the looks of this," Ernie moaned. He turned to
Captain Memory. "Can't you get us out of here?" he pleaded.
Captain Memory frowned. He seemed lost in thought. "Well, I
suppose it's worth a try," he said dubiously. With that, he turned
suddenly and slugged Ernie in the stomach, hard.
"Oof!" Ernie doubled over in pain. "Hey, what....BEEP BEEP
BEEP!" Ernie was astounded at the sounds coming out of his mouth.
"Good!" Captain Memory cheered. "It still works!"
Ernie coughed. "What..what still works?"
"The remote!" Captain Memory seemed particularly cheerful. "I
just remembered that a Franglian remote will still work, even if
you eat it! Quality construction, you know!" He nodded wisely. "I
paid a little extra, but it was worth it!"
The Captain regarded Ernie carefully. "The only problem is,
it's a little hard to press the buttons! Let me see..." Without
warning, he elbowed Ernie violently in the kidneys.
Ernie fell to the ground in pain. He opened his mouth: "BEEP
BOOP!"
Captain Memory looked embarrassed. "Oh, sorry. Wrong button!"
The toe of his boot slammed into Ernie's ribs. "BOOP BEEP!" 
"There we go!" Captain Memory exulted. "Now we've got it!"
Ernie lay in the dirt, moaning. Captain Memory reached down to
help him to his feet. "Sorry about that," he apologized. "Still,
you have to expect that sort of thing if you're going to go around
eating remote control units!"
Ernie staggered to his feet, moaning.
"Look!" the Fly pointed up into the sky. A bright object
seemed to be descending in their direction.
Captain Memory looked at his bare wrist. "Ah, here he comes!
Right on time!" The Captain looked at his wrist more closely.
"Well, almost on time."
As the bright object approached, Ernie began to make it out
more clearly. It looked like, well, it looked like an overly-large
1957 Plymouth taxi. It had huge fins, two-tone paint, and rather a
lot of rust.
Captain Memory gestured proudly towards it as it came in for
a landing. "There it is, guys!" he announced proudly. "The Luna C!
Ain't she a beauty?"
Sterno glanced behind them. The sounds of commotion back on
the trail were increasing. "Not a moment too soon!" he muttered.
Ernie watched the Luna C as it approached for a landing. He
noticed that it seemed to be coming in rather fast. With a
deafening crash, the Luna C slammed into the ground, throwing a
cloud of dust and dirt in all directions. As the dust settled,
Ernie noticed a hubcap rolling listlessly away, finally coming to
a stop by a nearby tree.
Captain Memory winced, but then quickly regained his
composure. He started towards the spacecraft. 
The driver's side door of the Luna C opened, and a lanky
individual with long, unkempt hair got out. He was wearing a loud
Hawaiian shirt, and dark sunglasses, even though it was night.
He waved at Captain Memory. "Hey dude, what's happenin'?"
"Hey, Ralph!" Captain Memory waved cheerily at the driver.
"This is my pilot, Ralph!" he introduced the man to the group, as
they all sprinted towards the spacecraft.
Sterno eyed the Luna C suspiciously. "This is your ship?" 
"That's it!" Captain Memory waved at it proudly.
"Then how come it says `Taxi' on it?" Sterno asked pointedly.
Captain Memory's face fell. "Well...well... I was supposed to
get a limo! Well, they told me I could have a limo, but there was
this budget problem... Anyway, I could've had a company car, for
sure, except, um, there was that problem about my license. So,
anyway..." He trailed off uncomfortably.
"So you hadda take a cab!" Sterno finished for him.
"Well... well..." Flustered, Captain Memory broke off. "Yeah."
Ernie noticed that the sounds behind them were getting awfully
close. "Uh, could we talk about this someplace else?"
Captain Memory glanced back down the trail. "You're right!" He
turned to Ralph. "Let's cruise!"
Ralph looked uncomfortable. "Uh, I wanted to tell you, dude.
We got a little problem..."
"Let's talk about it on the way," he suggested, glancing back
down the trail. "The guys around here are, um, uncool!"
Ralph nodded understandingly. "I can dig it!" He got into the
driver's seat, while the other four piled into the roomy back seat.
Ralph shifted into `Fly', and stomped on the accelerator. The
Luna C instantly shot thirty feet straight up into the air,
violently flipped upside-down, and hung there, unmoving.
Ernie, Sterno, and the Fly suddenly found themselves upside-
down, in a very uncomfortable position, laying halfway on the roof
and halfway in their seats. Captain Memory and Ralph, however, were
sitting quite comfortably in their seats as though glued into them.
"So, like I was saying, dude," Ralph went on conversationally.
"We got this little problem..."
In the position he was in, Ernie could see the ground beneath
them quite clearly through the Luna C's large rear window. Their
seemed to be some kind of commotion taking place. The probing
searchlights and the bobbing torches seemed to have come together.
Ernie heard shouts, screams, machine-gun fire. Then, all was
silent. 
After a few moments, the drums and chanting began again. "Oom
alla boom! Oom alla BOOM!" Ernie could see a fire being lit beneath
the huge iron pot. It looked as though the Cannibals were going to
have their feast, after all!
Ernie's attention returned to the conversation inside the
space taxi. Ralph was telling his story animatedly. "....so I wired
the framistatter to the quark generator..." Ralph could see that
Captain Memory was about to say something, but he cut him off.
"Yeah, I know you're not supposed to do it. I know, `Warning: Do
Not Bypass Overload Protection....' Who listens to that crap? So
anyway, it really kicked up the horsepower, you know what I mean?
And when the light turned green, man, I was outta there! Those guys
in the 'Vette, man, they couldn't believe it!You shoulda seen
their faces! It was...."
"So, what happened?" Captain Memory interrupted.
Ralph became suddenly subdued. "Okay, so maybe the left rear
antimatter coupler got toasted! It's no biggie! We'll stop at the
parts store, we'll pick up a new one! It's just a couple bucks! It
was worth it! You shoulda seen those guys' faces!"
Captain Memory shook his head sadly. "I got some bad news for
you, Ralph. The parts store's closed."
"Oh, MAN!" Ralph was annoyed. "You mean we're gonna have to
hang out until the store opens? What a drag!" Ralph shook his head
unhappily. "So, like, when does it open?"
Captain Memory regarded his wrist carefully. "Let's see, it's
9:30 right now.... So, I would say, it'll probably open in about,
oh, two billion years!"
"Oh, MAN!" Ralph was really upset. "I can't wait two billion
years! I got a date on Friday!"
Ernie whimpered. "Does that mean the ship won't fly?"
"Hey, be cool!" Ralph said comfortingly. "Sure it'll fly! It's
just a little, uh, handling problem! That's all! Fly's great! Just
doesn't, uh, handle exactly right!" It was beginning to occur to
Ralph that perhaps wiring the framisttater to the quark generator
might not have been such a good idea, after all.
"Handling problem?" inquired Sterno, and he wriggled about
trying to find a comfortable position in the upside-down vehicle.
"Is this part of the `handling problem'?"
"Hey, it flies fine!" Ralph insisted. "So, maybe it's upside-
down! I mean..."
"And sideways!" Captain Memory reminded Ralph.
"Oh, yeah," Ralph became quiet. "Sideways. Okay, so it only
goes upside-down and sideways. Hey, it's no biggie! It gets you
where you're going, right? Okay, so maybe you wouldn't want to take
any long trips in it right now, but it get's you.... Uh, well, it
gets you to the parts store!" he concluded triumphantly.
"The parts store's closed, Ralph," Captain Memory reminded him
gently.
The Fly's antennae suddenly quivered. "I know!" he said
excitedly. "How about Road Service? Can you call for a tow?"
Ralph fidgeted uncomfortably. "Well, um, I sorta been having
this problem with the towing company... There's this, um, unpaid
balance...."
Ernie and the Fly looked at Captain Memory. He shrugged. "Hey,
I don't got insurance, you know?"
Captain Memory suddenly perked up. "Hey Ralph!" he cried.
"What about Warp drive?"
Ralph brightened, and then slowly resumed his glum expression.
"Uh, well, I don't think you wanna use the Warp drive right now,"
he shook his head sadly.
Captain Memory frowned. "Why not?"
Ralph fidgeted. "Well, it's been kinda acting up a little," he
explained. "I been meaning to get something done about it. Just
yesterday, I said to myself `Ralph, you know you really oughta get
that warp drive took care of' But, uh, you know, it's like fifty
credits minimum just to have 'em look at it, and, uh..." He trailed
off.
Captain Memory looked confused. "Didn't you get the Repair
Requisition Voucher from the Main Office?"
Ralph looked very uncomfortable. "Um, uh, yeah. Well, the
other night me and the boys was playing a little cards, see, and I
had this great hand! I had three Galaxies! How could I lose, right?
But I was all outta chips! All I had left was the Voucher, so I
said..."
Captain Memory shook his head sadly. "That's against the
rules, Ralph!"
Ralph sighed. "Well, how was I to know the other guy had five
Nebulae? You know what the odds against that are?"
Ernie racked his brains for a solution to the problem. "Maybe
we could just, sort of, give it a try," he suggested hopefully.
Ralph sighed. "Well, I thought of that, but last time I tried
it, I wound up in, um, Dimension 9!"
Captain Memory was startled. "Dimension 9! Oh, no wonder!" He
chuckled. "You sure don't wanna wind up in Dimension 9, do you?"
Ralph nodded his head glumly. "That's for sure!" They all fell
silent.
After a few minutes, Ernie heard the sound of snoring. He
squinted through the near-complete darkness, the only light coming
from the lights on the dashboard. Ralph seemed to have dropped off
to sleep. Captain Memory seemed to be nodding as well. Lacking any
better ideas, Ernie slowly worked himself around to a comfortable
position, and fell asleep as well.


CHAPTER 9

It was dawn when Ernie awoke. During the night, the Luna C
seemed to have drifted quietly to the ground, and was now lying on
it's top in the dirt. Ernie peered out the windows. The clearing 
was deserted, but signs of last night's revelry remained. The large
iron pot was tipped over on it's side, empty. Various bones lay
scattered about. Lying here and there was what appeared to be an
occasional jackboot. Ernie tried not to look at them.
After a few moments, the others began to stir. The Fly moaned.
"Oh man, I hate sleeping in the car! Look at my suit! It's all
rumpled!" Only Sterno seemed comfortable, curled up in a doglike
position on the ceiling of the upside-down space taxi.
Ernie twisted uncomfortably. He was feeling very stiff and
achy after sleeping in an odd position in the car. Thinking about
it, his stomach didn't feel very good, either.
Captain Memory blinked confusedly and looked around. Ralph
yawned. The Captain looked pointedly at Ralph. "Well," he said
unhappily. "I guess there's no getting around it, is there?"
"Oh, no," said Ralph dejectedly.
"You gotta do it," Captain Memory shook his head despondently.
"You're gonna have to call the office."
"Oh MAN!" Ralph didn't seem to like this idea at all. "I hate
calling the office! They always give me a hard time! They'll
probably leave me on hold forever, too!"
Captain Memory shook his head sadly. "It's gotta be done,
Ralph!"
Ralph sighed. "Oh, okay." He reached under the seat and pulled
out what appeared to be a car phone. He picked up the handset and
dialed, looking very glum.
"Hi Stella, it's Ralph." Ernie could only hear Ralph's side of
the conversation. Ralph seemed upset. "Look Stella, don't start up
with me, okay? I'm having a bad day, okay? Look, it wasn't my
fault! Anyway, I gotta talk to the boss, is he... Oh no, Stella,
don't put me on..." Suddenly, Ralph froze into immobility. Ernie
peered at him. Ralph was absolutely motionless, like a statue. He
didn't even seem to be breathing.
Ernie turned to Captain Memory. "What happened to Ralph?"
Captain Memory seemed unconcerned. "Oh, they put him on
`hold'."
"On `Hold'?" Ernie was uncomprehending.
Captain Memory shrugged. "Well, you know, they always do that
when you want to talk to the boss. You can't expect him to drop
everything just to talk to YOU, can you?" The Captain chuckled at
the thought.
Ernie peered at Ralph. "He's not breathing!"
"No, he doesn't need to. He's in suspended animation," the
Captain explained, yawning and stretching. "That way, you're not
aware of how much time has passed while you're waiting for your
connection!"
Ernie frowned. "I don't think I'd like that."
Captain Memory shrugged. "I guess they feel it's kinder that
way," he conjectured.
"`Kinder?'" Ernie was having a hard time with all of this.
"It's either that or Muzak," Sterno explained.
"Oh." Ernie considered this. "Yeah, I guess suspended
animation would be better!" He looked over at Ralph. "So, how long
is he gonna be like that?"
"Let me see..." Captain Memory examined his bare wrist
closely. "It's ten o'clock now, so I'd say, oh, about two billion
years."
"Two billion years!" Ernie was aghast.
"Look at the bright side," Captain Memory went on cheerfully.
"By then, the parts store will be open!"
Ernie moaned. "What are we supposed to do in the meantime?"
Captain Memory frowned. "Good point! We can't very well sit
around here, can we?" He chuckled. "Might as well hit the road!" He
opened the car door, and flipped himself neatly around from his
current sitting position, which was, of course, upside-down
relative to the others, and landed neatly on his feet on the ground
outside. He turned to Ernie. "Coming?"
Ernie crawled painfully out through the open car door, and
struggled to his feet on the ground outside. 
The group assembled themselves outside the upside-down taxi,
all of them stretching and yawning. Ernie peered into the interior
of the taxi until he spotted his coffee maker, which he carefully
retrieved. He stood up beside the taxi, and looked about
confusedly. 
Sterno seemed to have regained his composure more quickly than
the other members of the group. "What is this `Office' that you and
Ralph were talking about?" he asked Captain Memory pointedly.
The Captain looked suddenly uncomfortable. "Well, uh, you
know, everybody's got to work for a living..." He trailed off.
"You mean you're not a full-time Super Hero?" the Fly
inquired. He seemed disappointed.
Captain Memory shuffled awkwardly. "Well, uh, you know, Super
Hero-ing doesn't pay too good..."
"What exactly do you do at this `Office'?" Ernie wanted to
know.
"Oh, you know, a little programming..." The Captain seemed
evasive.
"Oh," said Sterno with relish. "This is beginning to make a
lot more sense to me now! THAT'S how you manage to do all these
tricky things here in Cyberspace! You're using the Company
computer! You've got a mainframe to work with, don't you?"
"Well..." Captain Memory seemed very uncomfortable.
Sterno continued. "I bet you're not running all this from a
PC!"
"Well, no," the Captain admitted. "I got a Cray."
"A CRAY!?" Even Ernie, who knew very little about computers,
had heard of the awesome power of a Cray.
"Well, it's not mine, personally, you understand," the Captain
began defensively.
"In other words," Sterno said reflectively. "You're using the
Company's Cray to break into Waldo Stadium's stolen systems and
free the Cyberslaves." Sterno's eyes narrowed. "Aren't you supposed
to be doing something more productive?"
"Hey, this is important!" Captain Memory insisted indignantly.
"Anyway, it's part of R & D, you know? After all, I could...."
 He was suddenly interrupted by the thunderous BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! of
jungle drums. A distant chanting reached their ears. Ernie
struggled to make it out. It seemed to be something like "Oom alla
boom, YUM YUM YUM!" 
"Maybe we should, um, get moving?" Ernie suggested. 
"Uh, sure!" The Captain agreed, glad to change the subject.
"Let's go!" He began striding purposefully forward. He walked right
up to an impenetrable thicket, and stopped, looking at it
confusedly.
"How about this trail?" Ernie suggested, pointing to a narrow
path that led through the underbrush in the opposite direction from
the trail they had come in on. It was also, luckily, leading the
opposite direction from the jungle drums.
Captain Memory snapped his fingers. "Of course! That's it! A
trail! We need a trail! Now, why didn't I think of that?"
"Good question," Sterno agreed.
Captain Memory headed purposefully down the trail; the others
following behind him.
Within seconds the forest seemed to close in around them.
Ernie could see nothing around him but dense underbrush. All he
could see ahead of him was Captain Memory's back. He supposed that
he didn't have much alternative except to just keep moving along
the trail. At least the sound of the jungle drums was diminishing.
Ernie began to be aware of a sound in the distance. A sort of
whooshing sound. It sounded almost like distant traffic noises. He
considered it. It was probably just the wind in the trees, he
decided.
Captain Memory stopped abruptly, causing Ernie to just about
pile into his back. "Hmm," he said, peering intently forward.
"You can get through that opening right there," the Fly's
voice came from behind. As usual, his hyper-acute vision had
spotted details which everyone else missed. 
Captain Memory pushed through a narrow gap in the bushes. The
others followed.
Pushing through the dense brush Ernie emerged on to.... a
clearing? No, it was a lawn. A big mowed lawn. About fifty yards
ahead was a large parking lot, followed by a huge chrome-and-glass
office building. In the distance was what appeared to be a major
highway, from which Ernie could hear what were, indeed, traffic
sounds.
"HEY!" A gruff voice interrupted them.
"Huh?" Ernie looked around confusedly.
"Get outta da flower bed!" Ernie looked down. He was standing
on top of a dozen beautiful, but crushed, tulips.
"NOW!" the voice demanded. Ernie rushed forward onto the
grass, destroying dozens more beautiful flowers in the process.
Ernie looked back to see the rest of the group carefully picking
their way forward through the flowers, careful not to cause any
more damage.
Ernie looked up to see the owner of the gruff voice
approaching. He was a short, heavy-set man in coveralls, smoking a
cigar. He appeared to be the groundskeeper.
He glanced at the group, and singled out Ernie. "Look whatcha
did to my flowers! Whatsa matter with you kids, anyway? You wanna
use the Park, you follow the rules! You stay on the trail, you
don't go walking through the flower beds!"
"Park?" Ernie was uncomprehending.
"Poodawumpus Park!" the gardener repeated insistently. "What
you just came outta! You stay on the trail, you follow the signs,
you don't be tearin' up the bushes!" He glared at the entire group.
"Um, we didn't see any signs," the Fly said carefully.
"Aaah, the damn kids tore up the signs again! Little brats!
I'll kill 'em!" The groundskeeper chomped his cigar angrily.
"Um, there were these natives..." Ernie began uncertainly.
"Yeah, o' course there's natives! It's a nature park! There's
natural natives in it!" He looked at Ernie suspiciously. "You
didn't feed the natives, didja?"
"No, no!" Ernie protested. "We didn't even get near 'em!"
"Good!" The groundskeeper seemed slightly placated. "They eat
what's not on their diet, it makes 'em sick!" He continued to
regard the group suspiciously. "You didn't leave no junk in there,
didja? Damn kids party in there on weekends, leave the trail fulla
junk! I once hadda haul a whole junk car outta there!" He glared
accusingly at the foursome.
"No, no," Ernie protested. "We're real neat. We never litter!"
"We don't allow no dogs on the trail, neither!" He glared at
Sterno. "Sign says so, right at da entrance!"
"Um, we didn't see..." the Fly began.
"Yeah, yeah, I know. Damn kids stole da sign! Awright, I'll
letcha off dis time, but next time I swear I'm gonna calla cops!"
"We're real sorry!" Ernie began edging away. "It won't happen
again!" The group started moving slowly in the direction of the
office building.
"Yeah, yeah," the groundskeeper was looking ruefully at his
crushed flowers.
The Fly shook his head. "Boy, is he gonna be mad when he finds
the Luna..."
"Sssh!" Sterno warned.
"What?!" the groundskeeper turned back to them.
"Uh, have a nice day!" Ernie said quickly. "Good-bye!" He
waved cheerfully, and started walking quickly towards the office
building. The others followed.
Ernie was confused. "Why is there an office building here?" he
asked Captain Memory.
The Captain thought about it for a moment. "Looks like it's
somebody's architecture program."
"I've heard of that," Sterno commented. "The architects model
a building in Virtual Reality, so that the clients can see if they
like it or not before it's actually built."
"Well, we might as well take a look at their handiwork," the
Captain decided.
The continued over the large parking lot that lay in front of
them. It was almost empty; only an occasional car was parked here
and there. They soon reached the doors of the building and entered.
In front of them lay a small, utilitarian lobby, typical of
cheaply-constructed office buildings. In the center of the lobby
was a booth marked "Information", but there was no-one manning it.
Most of the offices appeared to be closed.
On the wall was a directory to the offices in the building,
which the Fly was reading carefully. "Mostly lawyers," he said
ruefully.
"We may need a lawyer after all the damage HE's caused,"
Sterno said, looking at Ernie accusingly.
"Me!" Ernie protested.
"Oh, look!" the Fly broke in. "There's an office that's open!"
He pointed down a long corridor.
"Great!" Ernie enthused, glad for an opportunity to change the
subject. "Maybe we can go in and ask..." He stopped, and looked at
Captain Memory expectantly. "Uh, what should we ask them?"
"Good idea!" Captain Memory agreed, although Ernie wasn't
exactly sure what it was that the Captain was agreeing with. The
Captain started off briskly down the hall, in the direction of the
open office. The other three followed behind him.
"Ah, good, you're here! We've been expecting you!" An
efficient-looking receptionist in a crisp white uniform greeted
them cheerfully.
"See?" the Fly pointed out brightly. "They've been expecting
us! Therefore, we must be in the right place!" The Fly was quite
pleased with this leap of logic.
Ernie looked around. They were in a large waiting room,
decorated in doctor's office green. The room was filled with rows
of chairs, and an occasional table, on which there lay heaps of
very old magazines. In the background some easy-listening music was
playing quietly. There was, as usual, no-one else there. Ernie
moaned. "Oh, man! Why would they be expecting us? We're not even
supposed to be here! What's going ON!?"
The Fly shook his head. "I dunno, man, sometimes you can be
just, such a downer! Why don't you like, lighten up a little?"
"Obviously," sniffed Sterno. "We must be in the right place,
because they are, after all, expecting us! How could they be
expecting us if we weren't in the right place?"
"But..." Ernie began. The receptionist interrupted.
"The doctor will see you now." She opened a door to another
room.
"Oh, good!" The Fly was pleased. "You know, I've been having
this pain in my neck..."He began rubbing it vigorously. "Maybe he
can give me something for it!" He strode purposefully through the
door.
Ernie shuffled uncomfortably. "I hate going to the doctor!" 
"Oh, come ON!" Sterno stood impatiently behind Ernie. "Don't
be such a baby about it!"
Ernie sighed, and followed the Fly, accompanied by Sterno and
Captain Memory.
They found themselves in a large room, with a dozen chairs set
in a circle. A few of the chairs were occupied. In one, a fat blond
woman sat, nervously munching something from a bag on her lap. Two
chairs to the left sat a very depressed looking young man, wringing
his hands constantly and moaning quietly. He looked steadfastly at
the floor, never looking up. A little further on sat a dishevelled,
wild-eyed man who kept constantly lighting matches. Every time one
lit, he would laugh hysterically.
Against one wall was a chair that was larger than the others.
In it sat an older man in an old fashioned, black suit. He was
bald, with a goatee beard, and smoked a cigar. He carried a
notepad, and seemed to be taking notes on everything that was
happening. He looked up.
"Ah, gut!" He smiled at the foursome. "You are chust in time
for ze group therapy session! Please, sit down." He gestured
towards the empty chairs on the opposite side of the room from the
other patients. The foursome sat down. Ernie carefully placed the
coffee maker by his side.
"Oh, you must be the doctor!" The Fly observed. He looked
around confusedly. "But, what kind of doctor are you?"
"A psychiatrist, of course!" The doctor replied. "You have
been having, hmm, some problems in regard to your appearance, ja?"
"That's right!" The Fly was amazed. He turned to the others.
"I wonder how he knew that?"
Sterno looked at the doctor's cigar excitedly. "I say, you
wouldn't happen to have an extra cigar, would you?" The
psychiatrist produced one from an inner pocket of his jacket. 
"Thanks ever so much!" Sterno lit the cigar, and puffed
contentedly.
Ernie was suspicious. "You've got a German accent!" he said
accusingly.
The psychiatrist drew himself up, looking very offended.
"Dat's an AUSTRIAN accent!" he sniffed. "I have studied in Vienna
with ze great Dr. Freud himself!" He peered closely at Ernie. "Zo,
you have zis feeling zat you are being persecuted, ja? Zat everyone
is against you?"
Ernie was taken aback. "Well, um, now that you mention it,
yeah!"
"Chust as ve thought!" the psychiatrist said, scribbling
something on his notepad. "Classic paranoia!"
Ernie was about to protest, when suddenly the door opened, and
two more patients entered. Ernie looked up, and then moaned. It was
Lucy and Desi.
"Hi, guys!" Lucy waved brightly to the foursome.
"Chick-a-BOOM!" agreed Desi. He seemed to have acquired a new
Cuban shirt, and another pair of maracas. They sat down on the
unoccupied chairs across from the psychiatrist.
"Gut!" exclaimed the doctor. "Now ve are all here; ve can
begin!" He turned to Lucy. "Now, Lucy, last veek you vere telling
us about your problem..."
"Oh, doctor!" Lucy exclaimed. "It's all those TV shows from
Earth! They're driving me crazy!"
"Ach, zo!" The psychiatrist exclaimed quietly. "Und, vhy is
dat?"
"Oh, doctor!" Lucy exclaimed again. "Every time we turn on our
Vidicom sets on my home planet, all we get is old TV shows from
Earth! Our sets are very sensitive, and your signals keep drowning
ours out!"
"I zee," said the doctor thoughtfully. "Und you find
zis...upsetting?"
"Oh, doctor!" cried Lucy again. "We're not humans! We're
reptiles! We don't wanna watch Earth TV shows! They're all about
mammals! `Lassie!' `My Friend Flicka!' `Leave it to Beaver!'
They're all MAMMALS! We want to watch our OWN TV shows! About
REPTILES!" She seemed very upset.
"Ach zo," the doctor nodded. "Und you think dat if you conquer
ze Earth, you vould feel better, ja?"
"Oh doctor!" Lucy seemed very agitated. "Don't you see? We've
got to do something to stop those TV signals! We just can't stand
it anymore! They're driving us CRAZY!"
The doctor nodded thoughtfully, scribbling notes on his pad.
He thought for a moment. "But, you are 40 light years from here, so
you are just now receiving signals from 40 years ago, ja?"
"Yes?" Lucy agreed tentatively.
"Zo," the psychiatrist continued thoughtfully. "Even if you
stop ze signals today, you vill continue to receive ze signals zat
have already been sent. You vill continue to receive ze Earth TV
shows..." He paused expectantly. "...for ze NEXT 40 YEARS!"
"NO!" Lucy screamed. She buried her face in her arms, sobbing
hysterically. "I can't stand it! I just can't stand it!" She
continued to sob uncontrollably. Ricky patted her back. "Chick-a-
BOOM!" he said commiseratingly.
The Fly's eyes clouded sympathetically. "Aw, gee!" His
antennae waved in consternation. "I hate to see a woman cry!"
Sterno nodded sagely. "I suppose I can see her point." He
thought for a moment. "I've always rather enjoyed `Lassie',
though."
A thought popped into Ernie's head. "What about `Rin-Tin-
Tin'?"
"Not bad," Sterno agreed thoughtfully, puffing on his cigar.
He looked almost like a canine version of the psychiatrist. "And
then there's `Sgt. Preston of the Yukon'. It wouldn't be a bad
show, if only King could get rid of that silly fellow in the red
suit!"
"MAMMALS!" Lucy screamed, sobbing with renewed intensity.
The psychiatrist stroked his beard thoughtfully. "Zere is,
perhaps, a solution!"
"Yes?" Lucy looked up expectantly, her makeup streaked by
tears. It seemed to Ernie that he could see a hint of something
green beneath it.
"Perhaps... ze time machine!" the doctor seemed deep in
thought. 
Ernie turned to Captain Memory in confusion. "Time machine?"
he whispered.
"It isn't a real time machine," the Captain explained. It's a
Virtual time machine. You aren't actually travelling through time,
but you might as well be. Like when we went back to four billion
B.C."
"Oh." Ernie was not exactly following this, but he noticed the
others glaring at him, so he decided to stop.
The psychiatrist continued. "Perhaps, you could go back in
time, back 40 years, und stop zese signals before zey start?"
"Oh doctor!" Lucy cried hopefully. "Do you really think it
would work?"
"Stop TV!?" cried the Fly, obviously very upset at the
thought. "Oh, no! How could we survive without TV!? It would be the
end of... of..." The Fly tried hard to think what it would be the
end of. "Of civilization AS WE KNOW IT!" he cried triumphantly.
"True," the psychiatrist agreed pensively. Lucy's eyes began
to fill with tears.
"But, perhaps..." the doctor continued slowly. Lucy peered at
him expectantly.
The psychiatrist went on. "Perhaps it would not be stopped,
but chust changed a little. So dot it vould not be a bother to ze
space creatures!"
Lucy sat up excitedly. "Oh, yes! Yes!" She turned to Ricky.
"Oh, Ricky! We could do it! I know we could do it! If only we had
a time machine!"
The psychiatrist smiled. "Vell, as a matter of fact, I chust
happen to have one right here..." He gestured towards a door that
Ernie had assumed was a closet.
Ernie was, once again, suspicious. "What would a psychiatrist
be doing with a time machine?" he wanted to know.
"Oh, it is chust ze thing for ze childhood trauma," the doctor
explained. "You go back in time, prevent ze traumatic incident, und
ze patient is cured!"
Ernie had to admit that this did, in fact, sound reasonable.
The psychiatrist peered intently at Ernie. "Vhen did you first
notice dat you felt suspicious of everyone?"
Ernie was somewhat taken aback by this sudden change in
questioning. "Um, actually," he though about it. "It started when
I first went into the Virtual Arcade..."
"Bye, guys!" Lucy interrupted. She and Ricky were standing at
the door of the closet, or time machine, or whatever it was. "We're
going into the past now, so we probably won't be seeing you
anymore!"
"Take it easy!" cried the Fly cheerfully. He was relieved that
Lucy had stopped crying.
"Um..." A thought occurred to Ernie. "Does that mean that
you're not going to needing my brain, after all?"
Lucy's brow furled thoughtfully. She looked at Ricky. He
shrugged. "No, I guess you might as well just keep it." Ernie
sighed in relief. Lucy continued, "If it turns out we need it after
all, we'll get back to you, okay?"
"Uh, yeah..." Ernie fidgeted uncomfortably. He had hoped that
the problem would go away completely, but that seemed to be too
much to expect. At least he didn't have to worry about it right
now!
Lucy opened the door to the time machine. She waved at the
foursome. "See you...uh...later? Uh, earlier?" She looked confused.
She turned to Ricky. "Bye!" he said, and ushered Lucy into the
machine. The door closed behind them.
Captain Memory yawned. He was finding this all rather boring.
"I wonder what's on TV?" he mused, pulling out the TV guide. A look
of concern came over his face.
Ernie noticed this. "What's the matter?"
"It's the programs," the Captain said, looking distressed.
"They've, um, changed!"
"Changed?" Ernie was uncomprehending. "Changed how?"
"Well, for instance," the Captain explained. "Instead of `I
Love Lucy', there's now `I Wanna Donna', starring Donna the Iguana,
and her husband Ricky the Reptile. In fact," Captain Memory flipped
through the pages quickly. "They all seem to be Reptile shows!"
Ernie buried his face in his hands. "Oh, no! Now, instead of
them having to watch our shows, we have to watch THEIR shows!"
Cm continued calmly perusing the TV Guide. "Aside from that,
they're pretty much the same. The plots seem to be about the same."
He chuckled. "Oh, look! Here's the episode where Ricky Jr.
hatches!"
Sterno seemed lost in thought. "That reptile lady's name
wasn't really Lucy, was it?" he asked the psychiatrist. 
"Oh, no," agreed the doctor. "Dat's only her stage name!"
Sterno's eyes narrowed. "Her real name wouldn't, by any
chance, happen to be...." He paused for effect. "...DONNA, would
it?" He watched the psychiatrist closely.
The doctor fidgeted uncomfortably. "Uh, I'm, um, not allowed
to divulge personal information about...."
Sterno cut him off. "Just as we thought!"Sterno puffed his
cigar contemplatively. "You know, some people will do anything to
get into show biz!"
The Fly's antennae waved worriedly. "I don't know if I'm going
to like watching Reptile shows all the time!"
The psychiatrist regained his composure. "Vith every
successful therapy, there is always a period of readjustment for ze
family. In time, you vill learn to deal vith dis new situation."
He turned to Captain Memory. "Und you must be ze one vis ze
amnesia problem!"
The Captain looked up. "Who, me?"
"Dat's right!" the psychiatrist looked at him intently. "You
have ze amnesia, ja?"
Captain Memory looked confused. "Not that I recall!"
"Chust as ve thought!" the doctor said triumphantly,
scribbling furiously on his notepad.
All of this was making Ernie very uncomfortable. "Hey guys,"
he whispered to the others. "I think maybe we ought to get going!"
"What IS your problem?" said Sterno loudly.
"Um, uh..." Everyone was looking at Ernie. He didn't know what
to say.
The Fly looked puzzled. "Is something the matter?"
"Oh, don't pay any attention to him," scoffed Sterno,
gesturing in Ernie's direction. "He's just paranoid!"
"I am not!" said Ernie defensively.
The Fly seemed confused. "Paranoids never admit they're
paranoid," explained Sterno.
"Please, please, gentlemen," the psychiatrist broke in. "Ve
must return to ze topic. Everyone vill get his turn to speak." He
tuned to Ernie reassuringly. "Ve must not allow our paranoia to
carry us away, ja?" He smiled. It seemed to Ernie that the smile
wasn't very friendly. But then, he thought, that's what a paranoid
would think! Could it be that the doctor was right, and that he,
Ernie, had become paranoid? Ernie didn't know what to think any
more!
"Zo," the doctor turned again to Captain Memory. "You vere
telling us about your computer hacking activities, ja?"
"I was?" The Captain looked puzzled. "I don't recall that!"
Ernie's eyes narrowed. He didn't recall that, either!
"Ja, ja," the psychiatrist said reassuringly. "Amnesia is a
terrible thing! Ve must begin your therapy right avay!" He pulled
out a gold pocket watch on the end of a long chain, and began
swinging it slowly back and forth in front of Captain Memory.
"Vatch de vatch," he whispered to the Captain. "Now, go back,
back....Vhat do you remember?"
Captain Memory seemed to be completely hypnotized.
"It's...it's so confusing! Images, numbers, it's space...yes,
Cyberspace! And it's all filled with strange images! Games,
pictures, old movies and TV shows! They're all coming at me! All at
the same time! They're filling my head! They're taking over my
brain!!" The Captain was becoming very agitated.
"Relax, calm yourself," the psychiatrist whispered. The
Captain seemed calmer now. "Go back, further back. Vhat do you
see?"
The Captain seemed to be in a daze. "Pyramids...Pharaohs..."
"No, no," the psychiatrist protested. "Not THAT far back!"
"I knew it!" Ernie broke in. "Ancient Egypt!"
"Please!" the doctor snapped, glaring at Ernie. "Do not
interrupt! Your time.... vill come!" He smiled evilly. Or, on the
other hand, perhaps Ernie only imagined that he smiled evilly?
Maybe he was really trying to help, and Ernie's paranoia was making
him imagine something else? Ernie just didn't know anymore!
"I remember... breaking out of an egg..." The Fly was talking
now. He, too, seemed to be in a daze. 
Oh, wow! thought Ernie. The Fly must have been watching while
the doctor hypnotized Captain Memory! Now he's hypnotized, too!
The psychiatrist glared at the Fly. "Quiet, please!"
The Fly paid no attention. He kept on talking. "A larva!
That's it! I'm a larva..."
The doctor attempted to coax more from Captain Memory. "Now,
go back..." 
The Fly broke in again. "I'm a larva, and I'm on a nice, warm
pile of garbage! Yes..."
The psychiatrist cursed under his breath. He turned to the
Fly. "Wake up!" He snapped his fingers in front of the Fly's face.
Both the Fly and Captain Memory awoke instantly. The Fly put
his hands up to his head. "Oh wow!" he said uncertainly. "I must
have dozed off!"
Captain Memory yawned. "That's funny! So did I! And I've been
having the strangest dreams!"
The doctor turned to Captain Memory with keen interest. "Zo,
tell me about zese dreams!"
Captain Memory scratched his head. "Well, I was in Ancient
Egypt, and I...." He trailed off.
"Please, go on!" the psychiatrist urged.
The Captain looked confused. "That's all I can remember!"
The doctor cursed again. He suddenly became aware that Ernie
was watching him. He cleared his throat, and regained his
composure.
"Zo," he began. "Now, ve give ze other patients a turn."
The doctor turned to one of the patients that had been in the
room when the foursome arrived: the depressed-looking man who kept
wringing his hands. "Why don't you tell us your name, and vhat has
brought you to see us today?"
The other patient looked somehow familiar to Ernie. "Vell,
doctor, my name is Holger Horses. Und mein problem, vell, it's mein
job!" He continued to look steadfastly at the floor, never once
looking up at the others around him.
Ernie thought it was very odd that this patient, too, had a
German accent. But then, on the other hand, perhaps he was just
being paranoid.
The patient went on. "Mein boss, he is so...demanding. If I
make even one liddle mistake, he hits me vith his riding crop! Und
if I don't make any mistake, he hits me anyway!" He sniffled. He
seemed about to cry. "It makes me feel so....inadequate!"
"There, there," said the doctor commiseratingly, handing the
man a handkerchief.
The man blew his nose noisily. "I mean, it's not mein fault
dat they keep getting avay! Ve lock them up good! But somehow, dey
get out, and I get blamed!" He sniffled. "Vhy do dey keep doing dis
to me? All ve vant to do is torture dem a liddle!"
"Oh, ja, ja," the psychiatrist said compassionately. "Ze
vorkplace is so demanding dese days! I understand exactly how you
feel!"
"Do you, doctor?" The man looked up hopefully, pleadingly, at
the psychiatrist. "Does dat mean you von't hit me vith the riding
crop any more?"
"Dummkopf!" the psychiatrist hissed. The man caught his breath
suddenly, and looked quickly back down at the floor. He began to
moan quietly again.
The doctor laughed nervously. "Vell, uh, perhaps ve had best
go on to ze next patient!" He turned to the other man, the one who
continuously lit matches. "Und your name, sir?"
"Vell, Herr Doktor, mein name ist Horst Manure," the man
continued to light matches as he talked.
It seemed very odd to Ernie that this patient, too, spoke with
a German accent. 
"I zee," said the psychiatrist. "Und vhen did you first notice
zis fascination vith...fire?"
The patient giggled. "Vell, it shtarted vhen Rome burned.
Flames, everywhere. The whole city in flames. People running,
screaming. It was chust...SO much fun!" He stared fixedly as the
match slowly burned down to his fingertips. 
Ernie couldn't help interrupting. "Wait a minute! How could
you be old enough to be in Rome when it burned?"
The patient looked taken aback. He looked quickly at the
doctor. The doctor seemed very uncomfortable. "Uh, um...ze time
machine! Oh yes, he use ze time machine!"
"What's he doing with a time machine, anyway?" Ernie demanded.
The psychiatrist quickly regained his poise. He peered at
Ernie. "Zo, do you haff zese attacks of paranoia often?"
Ernie was caught off guard. "Um...uh...yes! Uh, I mean, NO!"
He was becoming very confused.
The psychiatrist nodded knowingly. "I zee!"
Ernie pouted. "I think there's something pretty suspicious
about this whole business!"
"Of course you do," Sterno puffed contentedly on his cigar.
"You're paranoid!"
"No, I'm...." Ernie began.
Sterno continued, cutting Ernie off. "You know, I've always
suspected as much. But, now that we have the doctor's diagnosis, we
know for sure!"
Something occurred to Ernie. "You `suspected' as much?"
"Yes, all along," Sterno maintained smugly.
"Well, if you're `suspecting' things, than maybe YOU'RE the
paranoid!" Ernie cried out triumphantly.
Sterno harrumphed. "I don't think that's..."
The Fly cut him off. "Oh, I get it, it's a game, right?" His
antennae waved excitedly. "It's `Find the Paranoid', right?" He
began bouncing up and down in his seat. "I know! I know!" He waved
his hands in the air excitedly, making incomprehensible gestures.
"First syllable....sounds like...!"
"SHTOP DIS!" the psychiatrist screamed angrily. From out of
nowhere, a riding crop had appeared in his hand. He was about to
lash out at the patient nearest him, when he noticed that everyone
was looking at him.
He stopped, and laughed weakly. He quickly tossed the riding
crop under a chair, and tried to regain his composure. "Zo, uh,
where vere ve?"
Ernie's eyes narrowed accusingly. "You had a riding crop!"
The Fly bounced up and down excitedly. "Oh, wow! He had a
riding crop! He's not supposed to have that!" He pointed an
accusing finger at the psychiatrist. "Personal foul! Lose 10 yards!
Do not pass `Go', do NOT collect $200!" He folded his arms
triumphantly.
The doctor smiled weakly. "Uh, I can explain..."
"I bid twenty," the Fly interrupted. "Three strikes and you're
out!"
Ernie noticed a framed diploma hanging on the wall behind him.
He turned to read it. He looked at the diploma, and then at the
doctor, and then at the diploma again. "Hey, guys!" he called out
to the others excitedly. "Do you know who this `doctor' is? He's
Dr. Heinz von Lie...."
"ENOUGH!" The psychiatrist slammed a riding crop against the
seat of an empty chair, commanding everyone's attention. Ernie that
the first riding crop was still under an empty chair, where the
doctor had thrown it. He appeared to have an endless supply of
them.
"All right!" He took off the thin, pince-nez glasses he had
been wearing, tossed them aside, and replaced them with a monocle.
"Zo, you haff discovered my true identity, eh?" He laughed evilly.
Ernie was pretty sure that the doctor really was laughing evilly;
that he wasn't just imagining it. "It does not matter," von
Liederkranz continued. "The interrogation will proceed!"
The Fly was confused. "Interrogation? I thought it was
therapy?"
"Interrogation, therapy, what difference does it make?" the
Nazi answered. "It's all ze same thing!"
Ernie pointed indignantly at Sterno. "See?! And you thought I
was paranoid! You were wrong!"
"I was not!" Sterno declared defensively. "I still think
you're paranoid!"
"But..." Ernie was totally taken aback.
"Just because he's really a Nazi doesn't mean you're not
paranoid," Sterno continued self-importantly. "Even paranoids have
enemies!"
Ernie could only sputter with indignation.
The Fly looked at the Nazi accusingly. "You said you were a
psychiatrist! We trusted you!"
"Ach, but I am!"
"Huh?" The Fly was confused.
The Nazi explained. "I told you, I am Sturmbannfuhrer Doktor
Heinz von Liederkranz! Und, vot kind of doctor did you tink I vas?"
Sterno puffed thoughtfully on his cigar. "That DOES make
sense," he admitted. "After all, if a Nazi torturer were going to
be a doctor, then a psychiatrist would be the one to be!"
"Precisely," von Liederkranz agreed.
The Fly's antennae waved agitatedly. "You're not going to
torture us, are you?"
"Oh, no!" laughed von Liederkranz. "Ve don't do dat anymore!
Dat's barbaric!" The Fly sighed with relief.
"Now ve have psychiatry!" the Nazi smiled evilly. "It's MUCH
worse!"
Ernie began edging slowly towards the door.
"Don't bother!" the psychiatrist called out. "It's locked!" 
Ernie lunged for the door anyway. No-one made a move to stop
him. The door was solid steel, and securely locked. Ernie glumly
returned to his seat.
Von Liederkranz turned to Captain Memory. The Captain hadn't
been paying much attention to the proceedings. He was still
engrossed in the TV Guide. He appeared to be diligently searching
for something to watch other than Reptile shows.
The Nazi smiled malevolently. "Zo, you didn't like ze Hot
Vhirling Corkscrew, eh?"
Captain Memory looked up annoyedly. "Not THAT again!"
Von Liederkranz laughed diabolically. "Oh no, of COURSE not!
Ve have something, heh, heh, MUCH vorse!" He peered closely at the
Captain. "Your mother never liked you!" he announced.
Captain Memory's eyes went wide with shock. "Aaugghh!" he
screamed, burying his head in his arms.
The Nazi chuckled sadistically. "I told you, psychiatry is
MUCH vorse! Und much more effective!" Ernie noticed that the Nazi
had discarded his cigar, and was now holding a cigarette in a long
holder. "Now, vill you tell us how you gain access to the system?"
Poor Captain Memory could only whimper.
Von Liederkranz didn't seem to mind that the Captain refused
to talk. It gave him more opportunity to practice his sadistic
psychiatry. "Very vell," he smirked. "You asked for it!" He peered
intently at the Captain, choosing his words carefully. "You're
totally inadequate!"
"NO!" screamed Captain Memory, curling himself up into a tight
ball.
"Heh, heh!" the Nazi chuckled. He looked closely at Captain
Memory, preparing his next shot. "You're..."
The Captain couldn't take any more. "Uh, 007C D0 C8!" he
cried.
Suddenly, the scene vanished. Ernie staggered with vertigo,
and sat down heavily on the ground. His eyes stung as a gust of
wind blew sand in his face. His head swam, and he felt nauseous. He
closed his eyes tightly, and put a hand over his stomach. "I think
I'm getting the flu," he moaned. 
After a few moments, he opened his eyes, carefully wiping the
sand out of them. At first, all he could see was sand. Then he
looked up, and saw... "The Pyramids!" Ernie breathed, in awe.



CHAPTER 10

Ernie looked around. The Fly was sitting in the sand,
attempting to make sand castles. Sterno was prowling around the
sand, obviously looking for something. Captain Memory was still
curled up in a ball.
Ernie struggled to his feet, and attempted to brush some of
the sand off himself. He walked over to where the Captain lay, and
tapped him on the shoulder. "You can come out now. He's gone!"
Captain Memory peeked out tentatively. He breathed a sigh of
relief, and uncurled, sitting up in the sand. "Whew! I'm glad
that's over! That was awful!"
The Fly peered at Captain Memory curiously. "That stuff he was
saying, was it true? I mean, like, about your mother and
everything?"
The Captain looked puzzled. "Um, actually, I can't quite
recall. But if it had been, it would have been pretty awful,
wouldn't it?"
"Wow," said the Fly in agreement. He thought a moment. "And
what about that stuff about being totally inad..."
"I don't want to talk about it!" The Captain cut him off
irritatedly.
Ernie looked up, and once again beheld the majesty of the
Pyramids in the distance. They looked a lot newer than he
remembered them. "Wow!" he breathed. "We must be in Ancient Egypt,
right?"
Captain Memory looked perplexed. "Um, well, I could be wrong,
but I think we're on a beach in New Jersey!"
"Ah, well," Sterno chimed in, still sifting through the sand.
"That explains all these cigarette butts and ring-pull tabs."
Ernie stared at him. "What are you doing?"
"I seem to have dropped my lighter," Sterno explained. "You
haven't seen it, have you?"
Ernie looked around. "Afraid not."
"It's so difficult to find anything in this shifting sand!"
Sterno stopped, and picked up something. "Here's a penny."
"Oh, yeah?" This might be a clue to they're location, Ernie
thought. "What kind is it? A Lincoln?"
Sterno turned the penny over. "No, a Cadillac."
Ernie scratched his head. "Well, that's close, I guess. What's
the date one it?"
Sterno examined it closely. "2,500 B.C."
Ernie's face lit up. "Oh, that explains why the Pyramids look
new!" He frowned. "But, what are the Pyramids doing on a beach in
New Jersey?"
"I've got it!" Sterno cried. 
"You do?" asked Ernie in amazement. "Great! What..." He
stopped.
Sterno was holding a small object triumphantly aloft. "I've
found it! I..." He stopped. "Wait a minute! This isn't my lighter!
It's just an old BIC!" He flicked it. A small flame appeared. "Oh
well," he sighed. "I suppose it'll have to do." He placed it in his
invisible pocket.
Ernie looked at the Pyramids again. "Uh, anyway, as I was
saying..."
Captain Memory sighed loudly.
"What's the matter?" the Fly wanted to know.
Captain Memory shook his head sadly. "It's a real bad sign
when you get Pyramids showing up on a beach in New Jersey."
"Bad sign?" The Fly's antennae waved nervously.
Captain Memory sighed. "Yeah. It means that the fabric of
Cyberspace is coming apart. We're getting really close to that
final, total sys..."
"Don't say it!" Ernie pleaded.
"..tem.." Captain Memory continued.
"Please!" Ernie begged.
The Captain stopped. "Why not?"
Ernie moaned. "It makes my stomach hurt!"
Captain Memory just shrugged. 
Ernie moaned again.
"Hey, guy," the Fly chimed in. He took a small package out of
one of his suit pockets and handed it to Ernie. "Here's what you
need. Have some Rolaids!"
"Oh. Thanks." Ernie tried a few. Actually, they did seem to
help. Well, maybe a total system failure wasn't that bad, after
all.
"So, what do you wanna do now, guys?" the Fly piped up
brightly.
"Beats me," answered Captain Memory.
"Haven't the foggiest!" replied Sterno absently. He was
engrossed in trying to light a cigar using the tiny flame from the
old BIC.
Ernie looked around. "I dunno. What do you wanna do?"
"Wanna go see an ancient, undiscovered, tomb? That sounds like
fun, huh?" The Fly's antennae waved expectantly.
"Oh, let's!" answered Sterno brightly. He was in a much better
mood, now that he'd gotten his cigar going.
Ernie frowned. "How do you know where to find an ancient,
undiscovered tomb?"
"Simple," the Fly replied cheerfully. "Just follow the signs!"
He pointed to an object in the distance.
Ernie peered in the direction the Fly was pointing. Sure
enough, he could just barely make out a sign, which said `THIS WAY
TO THE ANCIENT, UNDISCOVERED TOMB', with an arrow pointing the way.
"Well..." Ernie wasn't sure this was going to be such a good
idea.
"Aw, come on, guys!" the Fly enthused. "It'll be fun!"
"Well..." Ernie was unconvinced.
"Do you have something better to do?" Sterno demanded.
"Well..." Ernie hesitated.
"That's settled then!" Sterno stated with finality. He glared
at Ernie. "And I DO wish you wouldn't keep repeating yourself all
the time!"
"Well..." Ernie began.
"PLEASE!" Sterno cut him off. Ernie decided to just be quiet.
The foursome trudged through the dry sand. Luckily the sun,
though bright, was not very hot. Ernie hoped they didn't have far
to go. Trying to walk through the shifting, blowing sand was very
tiring. The approached the sign.
The sign seemed to be pointing to something behind one of the
Pyramids. As they rounded the corner, they became able to see what
it was.
"Wow!" breathed Ernie in awe. A fabulous Egyptian temple stood
in front of them. Crumbling columns towered 200 feet into the sky,
supporting a sandstone roof that had collapsed at various points.
In the center of the temple stood a large stone structure with no
windows, and only one door, which was closed.
After a few moments, Ernie noticed that there was a small,
brightly-colored wooden building standing in front of the temple.
A sign on the little building said `SEE THE ANCIENT, UNDISCOVERED
TOMB! Admission: $2.00.'
Inside the small building was a portly, middle-aged man
wearing a bright plaid suit and a straw hat, and smoking a cigar.
"Step right up, gentlemen!" he cried to them. "Yer just in time!"
"Oh, wow!" said the Fly, obviously excited. "We wanna see the
tomb!"
"Of course you do, sonny," said the man, flicking the ash of
his cigar. "Everybody wants to see the tomb! Let's see, there's
four at two dollars each..." He looked the group over. "I'll tell
you what I'm gonna do. Because I like yer, uh..." He looked at the
Fly with puzzlement. "...face, I'm gonna give you a special price.
Only $10 for all of ya!"
"Gee, thanks!" said the Fly enthusiastically. Ernie opened his
mouth to speak.
"Hey, that's okay, guys," the Fly cut him off. "It's on me!"
He handed the ticket-seller a $10 bill. 
"Step right on in, gentlemen!" The ticket-seller gestured
towards the door of the tomb.
As they approached, Ernie examined the hieroglyphics on the
walls of the temple. Suddenly, one caught his eye. "Look!" He
pointed it out. "It's the RCA dog! And the phonograph! This must
be..."
"Oh, your not going to start that `Dead Sea Phonograph
Records' business again, are you?" Sterno said irritatedly.
"Well..." Ernie began.
"Will you PLEASE stop saying that!" Sterno cried in
exasperation. Ernie shut up.
The interior of the building did, in fact, look like an
ancient, undiscovered tomb. Mummy cases lined the walls. Strange
carved containers, some shaped like animals, lay on all sides.
Drifting sand lay piled up against everything. 
"Wow!" The Fly was amazed. "An ancient, undiscovered tomb! I
bet we're the first people to be in here in a zillion years!"
An ancient wooden cabinet caught Ernie's attention. The figure
of the RCA dog was carved into it. Ernie opened it gingerly. "Aha!"
he cried. "Look!"
Inside, sure enough, was an ancient, acoustic Victrola-type
record player. Lined up neatly in slots were dozens of flat black
disks that could only be 78 rpm records. "See?" proclaimed Ernie.
"I told you so! It's the Dead Sea Phonograph Records!"
"Cool!" enthused the Fly. "Play it!"
Ernie was taken aback. This could be the greatest find of all
time! It could change the world; completely alter Life As We Know
It. He had to be very careful. One mistake might ruin the whole
thing. If he made the wrong move, the greatest discovery in history
might be lost forever - and it would be all his fault!"Um, play
it?" Ernie hesitated uncomfortably. "Um, I'm not sure..."
"Play it!" demanded Sterno irritably. "You've been going on
and on about this for...for..." Sterno thought a moment. "Actually,
for BILLIONS of years, now, and we're all just about sick of it!
All right, here it is! Now, play it, already!"
Ernie looked over the machine warily. "Um, I'm not exactly
sure how to work it." He tugged at one of the 78 rpm records. It
refused to come out of it's slot.
Sterno sighed in exasperation. "It's simple enough! Look!" He
pointed to a corroded metal strip on the bottom part of the
machine. There were a number of buttons on it, and a slot. Next to
the slot Ernie could just barely make out the words "Insert Coin."
Ernie searched through his pockets. "Um..."
"Oh, all right!" Sterno snapped annoyedly. "Here!" He handed
Ernie the Cadillac penny.
"Um, thanks." Ernie dropped the coin into the slot. For a
moment, nothing happened. Then, slowly, the ancient machine began
to creak into action. A small, dim, light appeared behind a little
square next to the slot. Brushing away the dust, Ernie could just
barely make out the words `Make Selection'.
"Oh, wow," said Ernie. Next to each button was a small
rectangle, which was obviously supposed to contain the name of the
song. Unfortunately, most of them were so covered by dirt and
corrosion that Ernie couldn't read them.
"Um, which one should I pick?" he asked in confusion.
"Who cares?" barked Sterno in exasperation. "Just pick
SOMETHING!"
Ernie peered at the selections. He was desperately afraid of
making the wrong choice. This might be his only chance to learn the
Secret of the Universe, or something like that. He had to make the
right selection! Suddenly, he saw something he recognized. "Hey,
look at this!" He pointed at one of the selections. "It's Sam the
Sham and the PHARAOHS! See, I told you..."
"Play it!" Cried the Fly enthusiastically.
"Play it!" snapped Sterno annoyedly.
"But...but..." Ernie peered at it more closely. "The song is
`Walk Like a Man!' I don't think Sam the Sham ever did that song!"
"PLAY IT!" shrieked Sterno, his patience gone.
Ernie frowned. He looked at Captain Memory. The Captain just
shrugged. "Well..." Ernie said hesitantly. "...okay." He pushed the
button.
The ancient machine slowly creaked into action. A 78 rpm
record dropped on to the platter, and the device began to play.
Within the first few notes, Ernie knew something had gone
terribly wrong. The music was growing louder with every second,
much louder than an old Victrola could ever have made it; in fact,
painfully loud. "This isn't `Walk Like A Man'!" Ernie cried. A
terrible realization hit him. If you took `Walk Like A Man', and
crossed it with Sam the Sham and the Pharaohs, you'd get..."
Suddenly, it was all too clear. He recognized the music plainly
now. "Oh, no!" Ernie wailed. "It's `Walk Like an Egyptian!'"
"What?!" yelled Captain Memory. The music was too loud,
drowning out their words. He looked at the others. He could see
their mouths moving, but he couldn't hear a word they were saying.
The music was too loud, drowning out everything.
The music grew louder with every passing second. The pain
began to build in Ernie's head. He tried to cover his ears with his
hands, but found it very difficult to do while holding the coffee
maker. It didn't help, anyway. The music was so loud that it
vibrated through his hand, through his head. The whole temple was
vibrating!
Ernie looked at Captain Memory. "Do something!" he shouted.
The Captain shrugged and pointed to his ears, obviously meaning `I
can't hear a word you're saying.'"
Ernie looked at Sterno and the Fly. They had their hands over
their ears, their eyes clenched tight in pain. Sterno especially
seemed to be suffering, his keen dog hearing more affected by the
sound than the others. 
Ernie was miserable. Not only was he in pain from the terribly
loud music, but his very best idea ever, to go find the Dead Sea
Phonograph Records, had turned into a disaster. The music grew ever
louder. Ernie knew that excessive sound levels can be fatal. They
were all going to be killed by `Walk Like an Egyptian' played at a
million decibels - and he didn't even like that song!
Ernie tried to hold his hands more tightly over his ears. If
only the coffee maker wasn't in his way....Suddenly, it hit him!
The coffee maker! He set the selector to `Destroy', aimed it at the
ancient Victrola, and flipped the strength lever to `Full'.
Suddenly, the Victrola vanished - along with the cabinet, the
wall of the tomb, half the temple, and just about everything else
Ernie could see. In fact, Ernie now seemed to be standing at the
edge of a huge chasm. It was so broad that Ernie couldn't see the
other side; so deep that he couldn't see the bottom.
Ernie felt a tap on his shoulder. He turned. The Fly was
pointing at the opposite wall of the tomb, and saying something,
but Ernie couldn't make out what. Although the music had stopped
when the Victrola was destroyed, Ernie's ears were still ringing so
badly that he couldn't hear a thing. 
Looking at the wall, Ernie guessed what the problem was.
Without the other side of the tomb to hold it up, the huge stone
wall was swaying. It looked as though it might crush them at any
moment.
Without thinking, Ernie aimed the coffee maker at the wall,
and flipped on the power switch. This time, his ears were just
barely recovered enough to hear the tremendous roar as the Psion
Megaforce Generator destroyed the other wall, and everything else,
for as far as the eye could see.
As the dust cleared, Ernie could see that where the opposite
wall had been, there was now what seemed to be a bottomless,
measureless chasm. On that side, too, there was a steep drop, as
though they were standing on the edge of an infinitely tall cliff.
All that remained was the 8-foot by 10 foot patch of sand and rock
which had been the inside of the tomb, where they now stood. 
Looking around, all that Ernie could see was the little piece of
land that they were now standing on, and the sky. Everything else
appeared to have been disintegrated.
As the ringing in Ernie's ears slowly subsided, he began to
hear Captain Memory saying something.
"Wow!" The Captain was peeking over the edge of the precipice.
"That Psion Megaforce Generator sure is powerful!"
Ernie carefully peered over the brink. He tried to see the
bottom of the crater, but he couldn't see a thing. No, wait a
minute. He did see something; he saw....stars? How could there be
stars at the bottom of a hole?
The Fly peeked over the edge as well. "Whew! That's some big
hole you blew there, buddy!"
Ernie continued to peer into the hole, trying to make some
sense out of what he saw. He turned to Captain Memory. "Um, how far
down does that hole go, anyway?"
The Captain shook his head sadly. "All the way!" 
"Huh?" Ernie was uncomprehending. "All the way to where,
China?"
Captain Memory continued to peer downward. "Further than that!
From the look of it, I'd say just about all the way to Mars!" The
Captain shook his head sadly. "You know, you really should read the
directions to those things before you use them!"
Ernie looked at the coffee maker in dismay. He placed the it
carefully in the sand, and gingerly edged away from it.
"Hey, this is really cool!" the Fly continued to look over the
rim. "I can see stars looking down," he looked up, "AND looking
up!" He peered over the opposite edge. "Hey, there's stars on all
sides! Neat! How did you do that?"
Sterno stared at Ernie, his eyes widening in horror. "You
didn't!"
Captain Memory shook his head sorrowfully. "He did!"
"What?" demanded Ernie. "What did I do?"
Sterno seemed to be in a state of shock. "You mean, that one
little device could..."
Captain Memory nodded dismally. "I'm afraid so!"
"WHAT?" Ernie was becoming very agitated.
Sterno glared balefully at Ernie. "How could you DO such a
thing?!"
"Will somebody please tell me what I did?!" Ernie wailed.
Captain Memory sighed. "Well, let me put it to you this way.
You see this little patch of ground we're standing on? That's all
that's left!"
"All that's left of what?" Ernie wasn't following this at all.
"Of the planet Earth!" the Captain declared morosely.
"WHAT!?" Ernie was horrified.
Captain Memory shook his head dejectedly. "I'm afraid you blew
just about the entire planet away! Everything except the little
patch we're standing on!" He peeked over the edge. "Looks like you
nailed the moon, too." 
"But...But..." Ernie protested weakly. "How could that
HAPPEN!?"
The Captain sighed. "I told you that thing was powerful!" He
continued peering over the edge. Something caught his eye. He
brightened. "Ah, good! That's a relief!"
"What?!" Ernie was desperate for any good news.
Captain Memory smiled. "You'll be glad to know that Mars is
fine! The blast didn't even touch it!" He peered more closely. "It
might be a little off it's orbit, but aside from that it's
perfectly okay!"
Ernie moaned. 
Suddenly, Captain Memory straightened up. He began looking in
all directions, a look of consternation on his face. "Something's
happening!"
Sterno glared at Ernie. "This is all your fault!"
The Fly put his hands up to his head. "Oh, wow! My head!
It's...What's happening to me?"
Ernie's jaw dropped in amazement. The Fly's head was beginning
to...change. As the others watched in astonishment, the Fly's head
shimmered, disappeared, and was replaced by the perfectly normal-
looking head of a man in his mid 30's.
"Whoo!" complained the Fly. "I feel really weird!" He
squinted. "There's something wrong with my eyes! I can't see too
good anymore!" 
"You're....you're normal!" Ernie gasped in astonishment.
The Fly put his hands up to his head, feeling out it's shape.
"Oh, wow! It's my old head! I got it back!"
Ernie turned to Captain Memory is helpless astonishment.
"What's happening!?"
Captain Memory, too, looked amazed. "It's the game! We've
ended the game!"
"Of course!" Sterno caught his drift immediately. "By
destroying most of the world, you've brought the game to an end!
There's not enough of the planet left to play with!"
"Right!" Captain Memory beamed. "And you've done it within the
logical confines of the program! Using materials found within the
program, in a manner consistent with the program's logic!" Captain
Memory reached out to shake Ernie's hand. "Good job!"
Sterno looked ruefully over the edge of the chasm. "Of course,
I don't think we got very many points!"
"It doesn't matter," said Captain Memory cheerfully. "It's
`Game Over'. That's all we need!"
Ernie was finding this all difficult to follow. "So, now
what?"
"Now the system shuts down, in an orderly manner, and we're
all free!" cried the Captain jubilantly. "The evil genius Waldo
Stadium is thwarted, his Cyberslaves are set free! We win!"
Ernie's eyes narrowed. "You talk about all of this almost as
if it was a game!"
Captain Memory seemed taken aback. "Did I?" he said
innocently. "Well, I'm sure I didn't mean to...." He trailed off.
Meanwhile, the Fly was engrossed in examining his head. He had
pulled out a small pocket mirror, and was looking himself over
carefully. "Hey, this is great!" he enthused. "I've got my looks
back! The babes are gonna love it! Awright! It's time to PA-A-A-
RTY!"
Ernie looked around thoughtfully. There wasn't much to see.
All that was left of the planet Earth was the little patch of
ground that they stood on. "What's...what's going to happen to us
now?"
"Well..." Captain Memory scratched his head. "I guess we'll
all be going home!"
Sterno put a paw over his stomach. "I...I feel very strange!"
he complained. "I..." Suddenly, Sterno shimmered, and disappeared!
Ernie was aghast. "Oh my god, he's gone! What happened to
him?"
"It's beginning," Captain Memory replied calmly. "We're all 
going back to our proper place and time...." the Captain hesitated.
"...wherever that is!"
"We're going back?" the Fly was enthusiastic. "AWRIGHT!" He,
too, had begun to shimmer. He flashed Ernie the `thumbs up' sign.
"It's PARTY TIME!!" With that, he was gone.
Now there was only Ernie and Captain Memory. "But...but what
should I do when I get back?" Ernie wanted to know. "I mean, after
all this, shouldn't I....I dunno, DO something?"
Captain Memory shrugged. "I guess you'll just have to wait and
see!" Suddenly, Ernie felt ill. The world began to shimmer around
him. The Captain's shape was becoming vague and indistinct. The
last thing Ernie saw was the Captain gazing ruefully at his bare
wrist. "I sure wish I could have gotten a watch, though!" he said
sadly. With that, the scene vanished.

EPILOGUE

Ernie's head swan. The strange, distorted shapes of a surreal
landscape swirled around him. He stumbled backwards, and his hand
fell upon a doorknob. Reflexively, he pulled it open and stepped
through.
A bright, fluorescent light dazzled his eyes. He became aware
of the sound of many voices in the distance. He staggered forward.
"All done?" A girl's voice startled Ernie. He looked up. He
was back at the Arcade! "Did you have a nice game?" the girl at the
information booth was asking him, twirling a finger through her
hair absent-mindedly.
"Uh..." Ernie could only mumble.
"HowEVER did you get that loincloth so dirty!" she reproved,
cracking her chewing gum loudly. "There's a five dollar cleaning
fee for that, you know!"
Ernie's mind was slowly clearing. "Uh, yeah?..." he managed to
answer.
"You can change in there," the girl pointed to a dressing
room. "When you return the loincloth and the broadsword, you'll get
your deposit back," she looked at him pointedly. "Minus the five-
dollar cleaning fee!"
As Ernie changed, his mind began to clear. Putting his own
clothes on again made him feel almost...normal. Had all of this
really happened, or had it all been just an illusion? Maybe it was
all just a malfunctioning computer program? Ernie couldn't be sure.
Ernie walked slowly home from the Arcade, trying to put his
mind in order. He looked carefully at everything he passed. For
some reason it seemed to him that things would be somehow
different. Yet, the neighborhood looked about the same, as far as
he could tell. But then again, he'd never really paid that much
attention to all the details. Some of them might be different, and
he'd never even notice.
After what seemed a very long time, he approached his own
house. He examined it carefully. It looked the same, as far as he
could tell. He took a deep breath, and went inside.
"Hello, dear," he heard his mother's voice come from the
kitchen. "Did you have a nice game?"
"Uh, I guess..." he called out in reply. "It was... uh...
different!"
"That's nice!" his mother answered. "Dinner's ready!"
Ernie walked into the dining room. He was still feeling pretty
woozy. Maybe something to eat would make him feel better.
Ernie's mother entered, carrying a large covered dish. Ernie
gasped. "Mom! Your hair...!"
Ernie's mother looked confused. "What about my hair?"
"It...it's green!" Ernie choked.
"But it's always been green!" his mother was puzzled. "Are you
feeling all right, dear boy?"
Ernie collapsed into a chair. "No," he moaned. "I don't feel
good at all!"
"It must be that awful Virtual Reality Game," his mother said
knowingly. "I've always said those things were unhealthy! It's just
too much stimulation for young minds!"
"Uh, yeah," Ernie agreed pitifully.
"Have some dinner and you'll feel better!" she said wisely,
dishing out a plate of food for Ernie. "I've made your favorite:
squid with mothballs!"
"Uh..." Ernie began.
"Your favorite TV show's on tonight," his mother continued
cheerily. "`I Wanna Donna' with Donna the Iguana! In fact," she
went on brightly. "All your favorite Reptiles are on tonight!"
Ernie sighed deeply. Well, he thought. It looks like I'm home!
Sort of.

even send the offending portion, I had to recover a
large portion from a major disk failure and may have
lost some portions.

For those not familure with the Vigilante, it is
a work in process,(has been for over a year now)
It is a Star Trek the Next Generation Universe story
but follows a different ship and crew.The Big E
and gang only make cameo appearences.

I hope you enjoy it and I hope to work on and maybe even
finish the last chapter, VI "Full Circle" some time this year.

"The Drawing"



Have ever you heard of the Land of Beyond,
That dreams at the gates of the day?
Alluring it lies at the skirts of the skies,
and ever so far away;
Alluring it calls: O ye the yoke galls,
and ye of the trail overfond,
With saddle and pack, by paddle and track,
Let's go to the land of beyond!
....
Robert Service
"THE LAND OF BEYOND"






The Tau-Epsilon star system was remote even by Star Fleet
standards, of course this was one of the reasons it was
chosen.It was also a very crowded system with twelve
planets and 6 different asteroid belts.The five innermost
planets were 'rocks' with the rest being gas giants.The
system also had a very uneven planetary plane making the
inner planets a little bit more difficult to approach.
The fourth planet from the yellow Tau-Epsilon sun had a
barely breathable atmosphere.In years past there had been a
small mining operation on the planet but it had been
abandoned for a more profitable system.The habitats left
behind, however, had made a great base camp for the project
now nearing completion.
Star Fleet didn't normally make a habit of constructing a
star ship in such a remote location.This ship, however, was
extremely unique not only in its design but also in its
mission.
The flat black of the space dock girders hung in a close
orbit around TE-4.Inside the frame work was a truly
different star ship.The large saucer section and warp
engines made it unmistakably Star Fleet.The saucer section
was obviously old, even the lowest cadet at the academy would
know that it shouldn't be tied to the new style warp engines
especially four of them.There were a number other things
that a trained eye would pick out wrong with this ship.Some
that shouldn't be on a saucer section that old and others
that simply were not Star Fleet standard.
Along the girders were a number of prefabricated
buildings.All habitats for the workers and equipment were
contained in the buildings set up along the girders.These
accommodations would normally be provided for either planet
side or in a nearby space station.That, however, was quite
impractical here.Once the space dock was completed the
workers were grateful to be away from the old mining
habitats.The VE-4 space dock had become a self contained
world with but one purpose, build the ship.
Most of the construction and workers were no longer
visible as they had moved inside the ship to make it space
worthy.A few white suited workers could be seen along the
girders and in and around the ship tying up loose ends.
Standing alone barely noticeable against the black of the
girders and the continuous night about them was a lone figure
in a black pressure suit.As construction neared completion
the man came and stood here more often, staring at the ship.
Captain Anthony watched his ship near completion, and
thought of the mission ahead, it was suicide by it's very
nature.This, however, hadn't deterred him from accepting
command.It also didn't have an effect on volunteers to crew
the ship even though no one knew the ship, its name its
design or its mission.All that was known was that it was
extremely hazardous duty with only single, unattached and
experienced personnel considered for duty.

Anthony glanced down at the displays in his helmet, the
Enterprise should be arriving soon he thought, it had entered
the system just before he had stepped out.The security for
the sector and the system was extremely tight.The
Enterprise would approach so as always to have TE-4 between
it and the Space Dock.The fewer people who saw the ship or
even knew about it the better.The consequences of
information falling into the wrong hands Picard and the
officers of the Enterprise knew all too well.
This is why Enterprise was the only ship that visited
TE-4.It is also why there were no records being kept of the
visits and the sensors were never used to check the
construction site.Simple beacons and indirect
communications were the only proof the Enterprise had that
anything was here at all.The only reason Picard went along
with this was that he knew the basic, ultimate mission of
what ever was happening here, that was enough.

----------

"Sir, approaching minimum distance to beacon signal." A
young navigator said as the Enterprise entered orbit about
the barren TE-4.
"Thank you, Ensign" said Captain Picard.He then turned
to his first officer and said "Number one, inform our guests
to gather their belongings and report to their designated
transporter....."
The navigator pushed a strand of her red hair off her
forehead and stared at the planet on the view screen.In the
background she could hear the conversation of the bridge
crew, however unless she picked up something pertaining to
her or her job she just filtered the noise out.
Ensign O'Malley was a dreamer and self proclaimed
romantic.She was born on the feral colony on Vega-5 and
adopted when she was twelve by Doctor Peter O'Malley.The
ships physician of the first star ship to visit V-5 in over
200 years.Many of the warlords of V-5 rejected Star Fleet
claiming the colony was settled before the current Federation
charter was signed, therefore, they were protected by the
Prime Directive.After months of negotiations Star Fleet
finally pulled out, but not before little Janice had been
adopted.
She had been on board the Enterprise for quite some time
but rarely worked with top bridge crew.Her normal shift was
usually second or third by the ships schedule.The only
times she worked with them was in special situations when the
captain's presence was required during her shift or an
emergency arrived.The only problem was that during
emergencies she was usually relieved for the more experienced
first shift navigator.This was one of those rare occasions
when something important enough was happening during her
shift to bring the Captain out of his hole but not important
enough for them to bring the whole first shift crew to the
bridge.
Janice O'Malley always dreamed of what lay just out of
sight.She had that desire to open a closed door, turn just
one more corner, to look to the other side of the horizon.
This caused great conflict in her during these missions, she
greatly wished to conjecture to her shipmates her ideas as to
what was on the other side of this horizon.However, for
security reasons all talk on the subject was prohibited.
During the first trip to the system Ensign O'Malley had
noticed that the automatic navigation log had been disengaged
prior to her shift.When she brought this up with the
officer of the shift he reminded her of the no record order
by Star Fleet and all automatic logs had been deactivated.
It was highly stressed that no one should talk about or enter
personal logs that revealed any details of the mission.

----------

Standing along the corridors of one of the lower decks
was a long line of assorted Star Fleet personnel with bags
packed and mostly looks of irritation.They had been
relegated to one small (comparatively) area of the ship, then
basically quarantined.The regular personnel had no contact
with them and they were not permitted in other parts of the
ship without an escort.Even though the need for extreme
security was carefully laid out to them there was still
enough complaining from a few to make the whole lot start
feeling discontentment.

"I can't believe it, they keep us holed up in one area of
this enormous ship for the whole trip than they don't even
have the decency to use all of their transporters to get us
out of here quickly.Its like first they don't want us here
than they don't want us to leave." The man sounding off was
one of the usual complainers.He was a large, barrel shaped,
bearded human who was apparently some sort of expert in
weaponry but no one was quite sure since he boasted
proficiency in just about everything.
"Mr Dolittel, why don't you bless us with your silence
for once.We're finally getting somewhere and we still must
listen to you babble on."The speaker was about ten places
down the hall from Dolittel.She was a dark skinned humanoid
who could look Dolittel square in the chest.She was slim
and well proportioned compared to a human female and wore the
yellow uniform and insignia of security.She was not tall by
any means but was well muscled.She had a high forehead
reminiscent of a Klingon but wasn't one.Her long black hair
was pulled into a braid and hung down the middle of her back.
"Commander Tarva, Sir, I didn't see you there." Dolittel
mumbled and turned back toward the transporter room.
Dolittel's griping had come to a halt, at least for a while.
Tarva stood patiently with her satchel at her feet.Her
stance was a classic military at-ease posture.Though a Star
Fleet Academy alumni her up bringing and background on her
home-world was very strict military.It was this strict
military background that helped her move quickly up through
the pseudo-military Star Fleet.
She could hear the constant hum of the transporters in
the room ahead as the line slowly moved forward.Suspicious
by nature and profession she could not help but feel they
were lined up like 'algots going to the slaughter'.

----------

As the Enterprise's transporter room dissolved around
her, a new one took its place.The room was extremely large
maybe ten times the size of Enterprise's if not larger.Her
background immediately showed it self again as she figured
one could transport nearly a whole Kalonian battalion at one
time from here.
"I told you, they could have transported us here in a
quarter of the time if they wanted to." of course Dolittel
would be the first thing she'd hear upon arrival.
Standing in front of the control panel for this section
of the transporter was a average hight, slightly balding
human with long, black-gray hair pulled back in a pony tail.
The man was wearing a loose fitting black uniform with no
visible sign of rank but some standard Star Fleet insignia.
The uniform had several large pockets on the jacket and more
on the pants, even on the lower parts of the legs.
The shoes seemed out of place with the obvious utility of
the uniform, they were soft low cut with a sole that could
barely be described as firm.It occurred to Tarva that these
were not standard for the uniform but were in fact boot
liners for a pressure suit.The realization made her smile
and think "I'm going to like this man".
A man in white coveralls of a construction worker stepped
forward and asked for their I.D. cards.These he handed to
the man in the black uniform.The man looked at each card
and though it was obvious he had done this with every person
who had come aboard he still actually read at least the name
on each card.It was not as if he were looking for someone,
it was as if he were trying to match everybody's name and
face the first time by.
"Welcome aboard" he said as he handed the cards back to
the man in the coveralls."I'm Captain Anthony," the hum of
another portion of the large transporter could be heard next
to them. "please follow this gentleman he'll show you to your
quarters.Be patient, this ship is still under construction,
some things aren't working yet and your also going to have to
share quarters with more personnel than they were designed
for until others are ready".As they gathered their
belongings and stepped off the transporter a woman in white
coveralls asked the new arrivals on the other transporter for
their I.D. cards.
"Commander Tarva." the captain said as Tarva turned to
exit with her group.
"Yes, Sir." she said facing the captain and coming to
attention.
"Please report back here after you get settled."
"Yes, Sir." she repeated as the captain turned his
attention to the new batch of I.D. cards, the transporter pad
she was just on hummed with new arrivals.Many people would
have thought Captain Anthony rude with them or at least curt.
Not Tarva, her only impression was that this man was
extremely busy.
Too much was happening around Tarva for her to fully
appreciate it.Workers in different styles of the white
coveralls worked all around, bunches of optical cord hung
from open ceiling panels, sparks flew from welding
torches..still under construction was an understatement.
Tarva also thought of the captain's order, to report to
him as soon as she was 'settled'.She wasn't quite sure how
soon this man expected her, she'd just have to do things one
at a time.The first would be to unpack then find her way
back to the transporter room.She still couldn't help
wondering what the Captain wanted with her, perhaps he had an
assignment for her.It would have to be important to signal
her out, perhaps Chief of Security.This wasn't too much to
expect since she was Chief of Security on the Eclipse.Even
if it was an escort ship it was still a responsible position.
What ever it was, it had to be one of the top security
positions, her background was too extensive to be simply
standing guard on the transporter room.
A cabin door slid open and the man in white said that
there was room for one more in these quarters. "and remember"
he said "these are just temporary until the rest are
completed."Somehow, Tarva found herself standing at the
front of her group, so she stepped in.

"Do you believe this, they have eight of us crammed into
what is obviously meant for four.This is a freaking
enlisted barracks.What kind of chicken outfit is this
anyway?"The all too familiar voice came from what was
apparently the head.
Tarva walked over to the one bunk that was slightly
separated from the rest, it was, without a doubt, the prime
real estate of the room.All other occupants were at their
own bunks, the only other empty one was a built in top bunk,
the least desirable in the room.Tarva picked up the
equipment already on her bunk of choice and dropped it in the
middle of the room and put her own in its place.The other
occupants in the room were Dolittel's regular companions but
they said nothing, just did their best to ignore her.
A chime sounded on one of the walls and a name appeared
on a computer screen."That's mine." one of her room mates
said and got up to retrieve a stack of folded black cloth
from a drawer that came out of the wall as he approached.He
then joined Dolittel in the head.
"What's that?" She asked, somebody had to say something
eventually.
In response, a tall blonde haired woman sitting on the
far side of the room tossed Tarva a laminated card.

Welcome aboard the U.S.S. Vigilante.

--- There will be a mandatory meeting for all personnel at
0830 in shuttle bay 1.This should give all a chance to
get settled.All crew assignments will be handed out at
this time.

--- Ship's uniforms are available from the replicators in
each room, just program required size.Standard Star
Fleet issue boots are appropriate. (a slight wait may be
necessary, full power is currently not on line)

--- Please make yourself as comfortable as possible,
as soon as more quarters are finished they will be
assigned.

Tarva checked her time piece, 0600, they had plenty of time
to get the whole crew over from the Enterprise even at the
current rate.
"Who put my stuff in the middle of the floor?!" Dolittel
bellowed as he emerged from the head wiping water from his
face with a small towel.He was already wearing a black
uniform identical to what the captain had.His shoulders
filled the doorway and his hair brushed against the top of
the frame.His gaze then shifted to the bunk he had claimed
with his gear.
Tarva smiled slightly and said "I honestly think you'll
be more comfortable on one of the regular beds, these
temporary cots are quite lumpy".
Dolittel looked at his friends and, for a moment, it
seemed as if he would stand up to Tarva.Instead he picked
up his bags and threw them up on the empty bunk."What are
you doing here, Sir?" he said to Tarva.
"Everyone must make sacrifices, Mr. Dolittel." She
responded.Then said "Computer".
"WORKING" replied the generic female voice.
"Commander Tarva requesting complete ship's uniform" she
then gave size and other particulars.
"Your going to have a wait we've all placed our orders
and only two have come back so far." said the tall blonde.
Just then the chime rang again and another of the gang
said that it must be his.As he approached the drawer he
looked at the screen and saw Tarva's name flashing."This
things fouled up." he said "It says here it's the Commander's
stuff." and gestured toward Tarva.He held up the pants they
were too small for anybody in the room except for Tarva.
"Thank you." she said and took the bundle to the head.
She stood in the door way looking inside.The crew member
who had just went in to change came out immediately.He was
half dressed and wore only the baggy uniform pants and black
tank top type under shirt.The rest of his uniforms he had
obviously gathered quickly and had them bunched under one
arm.
"There's got to be some mistake, this thing's got the
rest of us qued up in the same sequence we placed our
orders." said the Lieutenant by the replicator.
"Typical of this place," said Dolittel "even the computer
doesn't know what the hell it's doin'.But don't worry, I'll
get things straightened around soon as they let me get to
work."

Tarva stood in the restroom in front of a full length
mirror her yellow standard uniform lay in a pile near her
feet.She looked at herself in the mirror.All she was
wearing was a tight black tank top and matching mid-thigh
shorts.On her right shin was strapped a black sheathed
knife, with what appeared to be a bone handle and flat black
blade, obviously not regulation.She studied the scars
visible on her shoulder, arms and lower legs.Many a human
doctor had offered to remove the scars for her but none
seemed to comprehend the pride she took in them and the
battles they represented.
She looked closely at her left cheek and neck, there was
a fine line, were a scar should be, extending from above her
left eye down her cheek and neck to her shoulder.An over
zealous human doctor had meticulously repaired this wound.
For all the years humans had been in space, they still
treated all cultures by human values.It had never occurred
to him that a Kalonian would view a scar such as this
differently than a human.She, however, couldn't feel too
bad towards the doctor since he served on the star ship that
rescued her from the escape pod after the Eclipse was
destroyed.

Commander Tarva had been aboard the USS Vigilante exactly
30 minutes when she walked into Transporter Room II to report
back to Captain Anthony.The room was empty of new personnel
only the captain and the workers were there.Most of the
workers were busily doing something with both the transporter
pads and the control panel.Captain Anthony looked concerned
as he studied the output on a tricorder a skinny man in a
white uniform was showing him.
Anthony looked up at Tarva as she walked in and smiled at
her."Welcome back Commander," he said "I hope you found
your quarters acceptable for the time being".
"I don't expect I'll be spending a lot of time there,
will I?" she said as she walked up to him and stood at
attention.
"Commander, as you may have suspected, my current staff
is quite slim, in fact before today I was the only crew
assigned to the Vigilante to arrive.That leaves me in the
unique position of selecting my own staff out of a relatively
small pool of volunteers.
"I have gone over the records of all personnel assigned
to the Vigilante and personally selected the assignments for
each crew member.Most decisions were easy, someone is a
navigator or an engineer, they have specific rank and
basically fall into place.Top command staff is never that
easy, however, Chief Engineer, Chief of Security and others
require a little more intuitive thought." He paused to check
the skinny man's tricorder again.
"This is it," Tarva thought, "he wouldn't be telling me
all of this if I wasn't getting Chief of Security."
"The reason I'm telling you this" he said turning his
attention back to her, "is that I had a difficult choice to
make for Chief of Security.A man named Simon Norton is
boarding as soon as we get this thing fixed.He's been head
of security on three different Star Ships most recently on
a Galaxy Class which he is giving up to volunteer for this
mission.I know this man, he has no desire for any other
command position.He is one of the best when it comes to
security."
Tarva could feel her world shaking, she had been so sure
of getting the position, it never occurred to her that
someone with such credentials would volunteer for a blind
suicide mission like this was rumored to be.
"I know this may be slightly disappointing to you
Commander." this was a major understatement and he seemed to
know it."I couldn't, however, put someone with your record
and diverse background in an ordinary position. That is why I
have chosen you as my First Officer.Congratulations."
"Thank you, Sir." she managed to utter in complete shock.
He had done this on purpose, set her up for the fall pushed
her over the edge, then caught her at the last millisecond.
This man had a vicious sense of humor, she was going to
really enjoy working with him.
"Now Commander we have work to do.One of the positions
I haven't filled yet is Chief Engineer we have several
qualified personnel," Captain Anthony pointed to the mess
around them in a sweeping gesture "I suppose now is as good a
time as any to make that decision.Your first assignment
will be to get this mess working and give me a call when your
ready to continue the transfer process."
"Sir, why doesn't the Enterprise just transport the
remainders?" Tarva asked as she took in the whole transporter
room.
"In order to keep the minimum distance we need the power
of both transporters and these two pads are the only ones on
this ship that currently work.Now decide on a Chief
Engineer and get this thing working.We've got to have it
working by 0700 if everybody's going to make the meeting."
with that, Captain Anthony left the room with eight white
coveralled workmen looking at Tarva.
Before the door had slid completely shut First Officer
Tarva's hand was on the intercom "Lieutenant Commander
Dolittel, report to Transporter Room Two immediately".

----------

Transporter Room II was soon filled with Tarva's
roommates plus a few others.Dolittel's feet stuck out from
an open, access panel under the transporter pad.His cursing
could be heard across the room.He slid himself out and sat
up.
"What the hell is this thing?" he said "I've never seen
circuits like this."
"It is state of the art in transporter technology." came
a woman's voice from an open transporter room door.She was
a medium height brown haired humanoid.A slight ridge along
her upper cheek bones making her eyes appear sunken was the
only obvious nonhuman feature. She wore the standard white
coveralls of the other construction workers.
"Doctor Cembera, I should have known you were behind this
mess."Said Dolittel as he stood to greet the new arrival.
"If this thing is your doing, where have you been while we've
been trying to get it back on line?"
"I was detained in engine room one installing a new style
dilithium crystal chamber." she said as she approached the
troublesome transporter pad.She then turned to Commander
Tarva who had been running diagnostics at the transporter
control panel."First Officer Tarva, I'm Crystal Cembera
chief engineer in charge of construction of the Vigilante.
I'm glad you were finally able to join us here at TE-4."
"I'm glad to finally be here." Said Tarva "Now if you
could help my Chief Engineer get these things on line."
Doctor Cembera looked at Dolittel with a slight grin and
said "That shouldn't be too hard".
Dolittel and Cembera obviously had a history but this
didn't seem to stop her from ignoring Dolittel as easily as
everybody else did.
Doctor Cembera started running a diagnostic on the
transporter while pointing out certain details of the new
technology to Dolittel."The main idea is to boost the
effective range three to four times."
"This is a great step forward", Dolittel said "you've got
the largest transporter room mockup I've ever seen".
"The next supply ship should have the parts we need to
get all three transporter rooms working properly." Doctor
Cembera said ignoring Dolittel's comment's "The technology is
so new, it's taking quite a while to get the chips made."
"Then how in the world did you get these two pads to work
if your still waiting on the chips?."
"I had to make my own chips,"
"That's probably what failed." Dolittel muttered.
"and is why we only have two pads working." she said
still ignoring his comments."It was a long and exhausting
job, I can only guess that something came loose." Doctor
Cembera crawled under the pad and disappeared into the
workings.
She soon emerged from under the pad and handed Dolittel a
blackened, fist-sized component."Both pads were down, so I
figured it had to be power related since they each run on
their own computer circuitry." She said as she reached into a
panel that opened from a near by wall.The panel contained
several different kinds of parts, obviously spares.She then
retreated back under the transporter pads.
When she came back out she said "OK, fire them up".
With that, Dolittel pressed a couple of buttons and the
transporters lit right up."Well," he said "Looks like I've
got a bit to learn before I can be an effective Chief
Engineer".
"Well don't worry, you seem to have a good teacher."
Tarva said.
"And quite a while before we'll even be ready to begin
space trials." Cembera added.Then said "Come on John, I'll
give you a tour of your engine rooms".
"There's more than one? And what's this about a new style
dilithium ..." Dolittel could be heard saying as the door
slid shut behind him.
Tarva frowned as she realized Dolittel just walked out
with out being dismissed.As more people arrived, she would
have to make sure proper Star Fleet regulations were
maintained.She then pressed the intercom button "Commander
Tarva to Captain Anthony, transporters back on line, Sir."
"Thank you Commander" he replied "I'll be right there.
Please inform Enterprise that we're back on line.Out".

----------

Tarva's tall, blonde room mate was working the
transporter controls, it turned out she was a top rated
operator, when it happened.The last group was transporting
from the Enterprise when there was a general abort warning
issued from engineering.The warning was almost immediately
followed by a massive power surge.If it wasn't for Chief
Swanson's reflex action to the warning all eight of the
personnel in transport would surely have been lost.She was
able toreverse the beam before the surge got through the
transporter.
The surge did catch personal pad number one.The result
pulled the person out of transport in a crimson flash.The
crew had no chance to cover themselves from the resulting
gore.The whole transporter room was immediately splattered
in red.On the pad, lay a writhing mass of tissue and bone
with blood spurting from what had once been organs.
Transporter Room II immediately emptied with the
construction workers and crew racing for the doors.Many
were losing their last meal on the way, others slipped and
fell in the blood.Chief Swanson, Fist Officer Tarva and
Captain Anthony were the only ones to hold their ground.
Captain Anthony and Chief Swanson had gone ghost white
with shock, Commander Tarva looked to the Captain for
instructions, all he could say was "Get rid of it".
Tarva walked over to a security panel removed a phaser
and pointed it at her former crew member.Her only thought
as she pushed the trigger was "I wonder who it was".It was
exactly 53 seconds since the alarm sounded.

----------

Captain Picard sat in his ready room with the Image of
Captain Anthony on the monitor in front of him.Anthony had
several drops of blood on his face and he looked slightly
ill.Behind Anthony, a worker in red stained white coveralls
was cleaning blood off a wall.The view was so tight on
Anthony, the worker was only occasionally visible."What
ever happened there" Picard thought, "had to have been unlike
any transporter accident I've ever heard of.What ever new
technology they're using on this project has to be radically
new and dangerous."
"According to my records, Ensign Shertz was to have been
my primary navigator."Anthony was saying "Now, I am without
anybody who is currently qualified for the position.Captain
Picard, I'm aware that a ship like the Enterprise is likely
to have several officers qualified to fill this position..".
"Captain Anthony," Picard said "Are you suggesting that I
assign one of my junior officers to your project?".
"Not at all." Was the reply "I was merely suggesting that
there may be someone in your crew qualified for this
position, who also falls under the other criteria, willing to
volunteer if given the chance."
Picard thought for a second then said "I'll put the
request before all qualified personnel."
"I'll trust your decision, let me know when or if you've
found a navigator for me.Anthony out."
The screen immediately went black and Picard sat staring
at the silence for a minute then said "Computer list all
ship's personnel qualified as navigator for a star ship."
"WORKING" the generic female voice said then immediately
displayed a list of over 30 names.
"Now delete all personnel who are married or have known
living family."

Three names remained on the list:
Commander Data
Ensign Janice O'Malley
Ensign Ro Laren

Captain Picard sat and looked at the three names neatly
printed on the black screen.Who would it be?If they knew
the mission of the project they would all jump at the chance.
That, however, was against regulations, all he could tell
them was that it is an extremely dangerous mission, perhaps
even a suicide mission.
If any of these three officers knew they were one of only
three qualified for this project, once again, they would
all certainly volunteer.Picard decided to post a general
notice to all thirty from the original list.Perhaps by some
slight chance the only one he felt he could replace would
volunteer.If not, he would cross that bridge when he came
to it.This was a strictly volunteer mission and he could
not make anyone in anyway feel obligated to volunteer.
Within minutes of posting the notice, there was a signal
at the door.It was Commander Data.
"Sir," he said "by your notice I believe I am the most
logical choice to fill the navigator position.Unless, you
count Lore as a living relative.I know that Star Fleet does
not recognize him as my next of kin."
"Data," Picard Said "I was expecting you, I tried to
figure out a way to turn down your request without giving
you what little more information I have about the project.I
decided, however, that to properly satisfy you I must fill
you in with what little more information I have."
Five minutes later Data left the ready room fully
satisfied that it would be extremely hazardous for him to
transfer to this project.As he left, he passed the red
haired Ensign O'Malley on her way to meet with the Captain.
It occurred to him, that she too was on the list of qualified
navigators.

This was too good to be true, Janice thought as she
walked in to see Captain Picard.A chance to transfer to a
secrete project, a dangerous mission this had to be good.
No more boring star charting, no more hauling diplomats
around, no more Ensign Ro taking over for her every time it
was just getting interesting.When the tour ended, she would
surely be assigned as primary navigator somewhere.
"Sir," She said almost before the door closed behind her
"have you had any volunteers for the navigator position?"
"Yes, just one," he said "however, upon close scrutiny of
his record we decided he was not appropriate for the
assignment."Picard sat back and watched her face light up
with excitement.
"Sir, I respectfully request a transfer."
"Ensign O'Malley I feel it is my obligation to tell you a
little more about this mission." Picard said "The notice has
always stated hazardous duty, however, since you are
approaching this as a last minute replacement I think you
should know that most consider it to be a suicide mission."
"Sir, this is a suicide mission?" O'Malley said quite
taken aback.
"No, I did not say that. I said that it is so hazardous
that the few people who know about it consider it a suicide
mission."
"What do you think of it sir?" she asked still a bit
confused by what Captain Picard was trying to say.
"If it works, it will be well worth the costs." he said
"All else I can say is that I have a personal interest in the
success of the mission."
Picard took a deep breath and looked at the beautiful
young woman standing in front of him.Her large gray eyes
looked back at him expectantly.Finally he said "If your
still interested I'll arrange transportation.Go start
packing your gear."
"Thank you sir." she said and snapped to attention.
"Dismissed." he said.
Ensign Janice O'Malley turned sharply and exited the
ready room.As she left, Captain Jean-Luc Picard looked at
her personal file that was on the screen during the whole
conversation.On it was noted the time and circumstances of
her adoptive father's death at Wolf-359.
"It looks like we all have a date with destiny some time
in our lives." he said to the closed door.

----------

It was finally happening, she was getting to look on the
other side of a forbidden horizon.Janice could feel great
apprehension though.Stepping into the unknown was always a
bit scary.She could feel her pulse race with anticipation
as she packed her few belongings.
Being a third string navigator on any ship never rated
the larger quarters.Ensign O'Malley, however, was a woman
of few possessions.Vega-5 if nothing else, had taught her
to approach life as a minimalist.She had very few
belongings and really didn't care for a larger billet.The
last thing she packed was an old style picture in frame.It
was a picture of her father and her, taken during her first
visit to Earth.She was still young maybe fifteen earth
years, too old to be considered a child but not yet quite a
woman.They were standing in front of some ancient ruins in
a country her father claimed his family name originated.She
wrapped thepicture carefully in a uniform and placed it in
her case.Of her few possessions, this would always be her
most treasured.
She wondered how she would transfer to her new
assignment, the survivors of the transporter incident had
been transpoted by a very odd looking shuttle.She wondered
if they would send it all the way back to get her.She
wasn't really sure what had happened with the transporter,
only something had gone wrong on the other end and someone, a
navigator, had been killed.They did not expect to have the
transporters working anytime soon.At the current distance,
the Enterprise could not transport her on its on.
Just then Chief O'Brien's voice came over the intercom
"Ensign O'Malley, please report to transporter room 3, with
your gear.".
"I thought," she said to Chief O'Brien upon entering
transporter room 3 "that we were unable to transport until
they got they're system back on line."
"I thought the same thing." He said "but they gave me new
coordinates for a different transporter.Apparently they had
shut it down for being in an unused area.They brought it
back on line to help tie up the loose ends before the
Enterprise's departure."
Janice hesitated stepping onto the transporter pad.
Though she had done this many times before, it had never been
immediately following a fatal accident.She looked to
O'Brien and he just smiled and nodded his head.So she
stepped onto the pad stood at attention and waited.
The Enterprise's transporter room dissolved around her
and was replaced by a smaller more spartan room. In front of
her, behind the transporter controls stood a man in white
coveralls."Welcome to T E four space dock." he said "We'll
be ready to transport you to the ship in a few minutes".
To her right Janice could see a large space station style
window.From her vantage point she thought she could see the
hull of a ship.
"Would you like to take a look at your new assignment?"
the man asked.
Ensign Janice O'Malley put her bags down in place and
stepped down to the window.Outside was something she had
never seen, a star ship in space dock.This was unlike any
star ship though, a small older style saucer section dwarfed
by four new Galaxy style warp engines.The saucer was
attached directly to a bulbous main body without the usual
neck lifting it away.The impulse engines appeared to be
raised up from the main body just behind the saucer.
There were other things wrong, the color wasn't the
standard star fleet white, it was more of a dull gray.There
was no name or number designation anywhere to be seen and she
had a clear view of the top of the saucer section.There
were other anomalies: antenna pods, miss placed orifices etc.
that were not indicative of either the old style saucer or
the new style engines or anything else for that matter.
"What is it?" she asked the man now standing next to her
also admiring the ship.
"She's called the U.S.S. Vigilante" he said.
"What kind of name for a star ship is that?" she asked
not really expecting an answer.
"Don't ask me," he said "all I do is work on
transporters".
"I hope you weren't running the transporter last time."
she said with a slight smile.
"No, Sir." he said "Besides, that was caused by a power
surge from engineering."
Just then there was a signal from the intercom."Whelp,
the Captain's ready for you, time to report for duty" he
said.
"I guess so." she said as she returned to the
transporter.
The small transporter room dissolved from view and this
time was replaced by a much larger one.In front of her
stood a man with long gray/black hair that was thinning on
top and was pulled back in a pony tail.He wore a slightly
baggy black uniform with several large pockets.Though he
wore no obvious insignia this man must be in some kind of
authority.
Once she could move again she stood at attention and said
"Ensign Janice Louise O'Malley reporting for duty, Sir."
"Welcome aboard the U.S.S. Vigilante, Ensign." the man in
black said "I'm Captain Anthony, did you bring your personal
file?"
"Yes, Sir." she said and handed him a small computer disk
from an outside pocket of her bag.
"Very good" he said as he slipped the disk into the
tricorder he was holding."Now, leave your bags here, they
will be delivered to your quarters.Right now, we are late
for an already postponed meeting.Please come with me."
As they left, she finally noticed that there were several
people in blood stained white coveralls vigorously cleaning
the transporter room.Another in clean coveralls approached
her bags as soon as she left the transporter pad.She also
noticed that a personal pad to her left was shattered and
blackened.She could feel nausea catch in her throat, what
ever happened here must have beenhorrifying.
All through the corridor the men in white coveralls were
hard at work.Many areas where exposed to the superstructure
some she could see down through several decks of framing.At
one point they had to edge along exposed girders to keep from
falling to the next deck.This was the same area a work man
had given them each a hard hat to wear while passing through.
"If we weren't so late I would have taken the safer but
longer route." the Captain said as they edged along the beam.
When they finally arrived at the shuttle bay it was
filled with more than a hundred black uniformed crew.Ensign
O'Malley never thought she would feel out of place on a
Federation star ship while in uniform.Now, while surrounded
by the crew dressed in the baggy black uniforms, she
definitely felt out of place.
The Captain walked her up to a short dark skinned woman
with a high Klingon type forehead and a long braid of hair
down her back."Ensign O'Malley," he said this is my First
Officer, Commander Tarva.
"Commander Tarva" Janice said in greeting.
Commander Tarva nodded and said "At least you've lasted
longer than our last navigator did."
"Your attention please." the Captain said into a loud
speaker."Once again I'd like to personally welcome you
aboard the FULTON class star ship the U.S.S. Vigilante, the
most unique craft ever conceived of by Star Fleet.
"I'd like to say is to remind you of the mission you
volunteered for.Our intent is an extendedhazardous duty
mission.We may be on tour for several years or more, with
no or little contact with Star Fleet.In fact, many analysts
believe we will not be heard from again.Now I want you to
reflect on this, because in a few minutes when I tell you our
exact destination there will be no transfers or shore leave
off the Vigilante until after the mission is completed.
"If you have second thoughts leave now, collect your
belongings and report to transporter room 2.The Enterprise
is currently standing by to start you on your way back to
your last assignment."
There was a stirring among the crew, as this sunk in.
Several groups discussed this amongst themselves.Finally
three individuals stepped forward and announced that they had
second thoughts.
"Very well," Captain Anthony said "I want to thank you
for the dedication that got you this far.You will be
returned to your previous position and no mention of this
incident will appear on your records.I must also remind you
to never talk about this project, all details are considered
top secret.Also, anybody who persists in questioning you
about it must be reported to Star Fleet Security.Finally,
you must never even discuss this project amongst your selves
once you leave this ship, it never happened is that clear?"
"Yes, Sir." they said together.
"Dismissed." Captain Anthony said and watched the three
exit the shuttle bay.
"As some of you may have guessed, the U.S.S. Vigilante is
not a ship of peace," Captain Anthony began "it is a ship of
war.We are at war, that's right we are at war and the
Vigilante was designed to take the war to the enemy.In
order to hasten the construction of the Vigilante, parts were
used from the destruction of the first battle.The enemy we
face is one of the strongest and most irresistible the
Federation has ever faced.The enemy we are going to meet is
the Borg."
At the revelation a slight murmur rose from the crowd.
Finally a voice came from the crowd."Sir, how do we expect
to accomplish this, over 30 ships were destroyed fighting
just one Borg cube.Now you plan to attack them with just
one ship made up of junked parts.What have we gotten
ourselves into?"
Captain Anthony smiled at this it was just the reaction
he expected, since it was the same one the project committee
got when they originally approached Star Fleet with it.
"Listen to me," he said "the superstructure maybe made of old
parts, however, the technology put into this ship is cutting
edge.In every area you will notice parts and functions you
do not recognize, this whole ship has become the proving
ground for radical new ideas.It will be our job to test and
use these new ideas.
"As we already know, as we use the new components of the
Vigilante things may go wrong.You have all been accepted
for this mission because you are some the best.I am
confident that working with the designers of the Vigilante
you will all learn the new technology and be become as
confident as I am in our ability to actually pull this off.
"I am sure you are also aware of the Borg's ability to
gain knowledge from our computers and prisoners.Therefore,
it is imperative that we do not unnecessarily discuss
functions of our departments with other departments.There
are new designs in all areas of this ship.Technology we
know that the Borg do not attribute to the Federation.
"Another unique feature of the Vigilante is the computer
systems.Though there is a central computer for the day to
day needs of life on a star ship, each area has its own
separate computer system.These systems are totally
inaccessible by the central computer.This does create a
problem, a galaxy class star ship can actually be operated
with as few as five crew members when in automated mode.The
Vigilante needs over fifty highly trained crew just to keep
it maneuvering in warp."This was a bit of an exaggeration
but he wanted to keep them on their toes or what ever it was
that they may pass for toes.
"By now, all crew have received their assignments, you
are to work with construction personnel preparing The
Vigilante for duty.I know there is a lot of work left to do
and little time to do it, but I am certain if we work
together we can have the ship ready on schedule.I also
expect that you should know this ship inside and out by the
first space trials.Now lets get to work.Dismissed."

----------

When Simon Norton had entered the meeting room, he was
last, as usual.He had a great propensity for being late.
It never seemed to be of his doing, however.It wasn't his
fault that the transporter failed twice before he ever got
aboard the ship.The last time, it left him stranded on the
Enterprise.The trip to the Vigilante was an eye opener.
The transport sent to retrieve them was by no means a
shuttle.It was a troop carrying 'drop' ship designed for
rapid deployment of personnel to transporter protected
landing zones.Only Star Fleet's few anti-terrorist units
carried this kind of ship and even they carried standard
shuttle craft.
It was strange that he was the Chief of Security on a
Star Ship that he had no idea what design it was.He didn't
know its class or it's layout.He knew it was something
different, the large size of the shuttle bay told him that.
Also the narrow corridors and small rooms suggested something
different about the Vigilante.He only wished that the drop
ship had windows.
Captain Anthony was sitting in a small room with his
command staff when Commander Norton finally got around to
joining them.The room like the rest of the ship was painted
in gray and other drab colors.In the middle of the room was
a large dark gray table with straight edges but slightly
bowed to fit with the bow of the room.Around the table were
ten high backed chairs securely fastened to the floor, they
were also equipped with emergency restraints and belts.In
front of each place was a computer terminal sunken into the
table.At one end of the room was a large display screen
obviously for presentations to the group.The outside wall
had several windows looking over the port side of the saucer.
Along the top of each window the bottom of the blast shields
could be seen.The shields all over the ship would snap shut
during red alerts and when in 'silent running'.
In the early days of Star Fleet before advances in
deflector shield technology blast shields were installed on
ships meant for some heavy action.If this ship was destined
to confront the Borg it would need them.
The small amount of time Norton had been on duty he had
spent his time reviewing the files of the other officers.If
he was to properly over see security he would have to know
with whom he was working.Now sitting next to Captain
Anthony in the Command Staff Meeting Room (or known simply as
the Command Room) was First Officer, Commander Tarva and
across from her was Lt. Commander Dolittel, Chief Engineer.
The fourth in the room was a tall female humanoid in the
white coveralls of a construction worker, she was sitting
next to Dolittel.Commander Norton had been unable to find
any information on the construction personnel in any of the
computer files.This had distressed him for he felt it best
to know everyone he had dealings with.
"Ah, Commander Norton," The Captain said, "glad you were
finally able to join us.I believe you should be familiar
with everybody here, except Doctor Cembera.Doctor Cembera
is the chief engineer in charge of design and construction of
the Vigilante."
"Doctor." Commander Norton said and slightly bowed his
bald head towards her.He then took a seat close to the
door.
"This meeting is intended to fill you in on some of the
specifics of the U.S.S. Vigilante." said Captain Anthony and
pushed a button on his computer terminal.On each terminal
and on the main screen a detailed picture of the ship
appeared and began to rotate slowly."I believe I'll leave
this lecture to Doctor Cembera".
"Thank you Captain" Doctor Cembera said as she stood up
and approached the screen."The U.S.S. Vigilante is designed
with three main features in mind: speed, fire power and
stealth.To quickly build the ship we decided it necessary
to use some space frames deposited at Memory Alpha.Most of
the parts used were in fact taken from the ships destroyed by
the Borg.We have, however, completely refitted the ship
with new technology from the material used in the hull to the
drive systems.
"I'll start with the hull, the original 'skin' of all
components was removed and replaced with a new composite
material.This material is much less penetrable and
detectable by all known or encountered scanning devices.
This makes us virtually invisible on long range scanners and
appear much smaller to closer range sensors.Windows however
can not be made of the new material so all windows have been
fitted with old style blast shields.If power to the main
deflectors is ever lost windows without the blast shields
would be extremely vulnerable to detection.
"It is a known fact that Star Fleet has a policy against
the use of cloaking devices on its ships.This policy does
not, however, preclude the research in cloaking technology.
The main goal in cloaking research has been to develop
adequate detection of cloaked ships.This research added to
what we have learned from the Klingons I believe has created
the most sophisticated cloaking system ever implemented.The
technology has been installed in the Vigilante.Together
with the new hull material we call the combined system A.C.T.
that is Advanced Cloaking Technology.With A.C.T. the
Vigilante should be completely invisible to the Borg and all
others for that matter."
Commander Norton interrupted "If Star Fleet has a policy
against cloaking how did we get a whole ship built around
cloaking technology?"
"Star Fleet regulations have very little influence over a
ship that officially does not exist." responded Captain
Anthony.
Norton sat back to contemplate the implications of what
the Captain just said while Doctor Cembera continued.
"The next obvious feature of the Vigilante" she said "is
the number of warp drives.With new technologies and
alignments these four engines should jump the Vigilante to
warp 9.6 from sub-warp speeds in less than a second.You
should then be able to hold warp 9.6 for an extended period
of time.Next.."
"Excuse me Doctor." Lt Commander Dolittel said.
"Yes, Mr. Dolittel." Doctor Cembera said with a bit of a
frown as if anticipating what was coming next.
"I led a team that did extensive research on these new
technologies and alignments as you call them." Dolittel said
"We concluded years ago that they create uncontrollable worm
holes around the ship using them."
"Is this true?" Commander Tarva asked.
"Yes." Doctor Cembera replied.
"Your saying you've built this whole ship around theory
that has already been proven to be flawed?" was Tarva's next
question.
"This was to be my next topic," Doctor Cembera said "if I
may continue I think I'll be able to answer your questions".
"Please continue Doctor." the Captain said knowing what
was coming next.
"Lieutenant Commander Dolittel's conclusions were
absolutly correct." she stressed Lieutenant knowing how much
that elusive promotion irritated him."This technology does
tend to produce an uncontrollable worm hole.Since taking
over what Mr Dolittel's team started, the elimination of the
worm hole effect has plagued me and other scientists.Not so
long ago I was discussing this problem with a colleague in
front of my young daughter and my daughter actually came up
with the idea that has made this all possible." she said
proudly.
Doctor Cembera's audience looked at her blankly. She
continued on ignoring the looks. "What my daughter asked was
why don't we control the worm hole.To tell you the truth
this had never occurred to me mainly because travel through
the warp generated worm hole can be extremely unpleasant."
With the word unpleasant a couple of people took a second
look at the restraints on all of the chairs and began to
realize what Cembera was getting to.
"These worm holes can also throw a ship many light years
off course if not further.If we can control the worm hole,
and get it to deposit us were we want to go, even with the
unpleasant effects, it could be quite useful.In other
words, we could get the worm hole to place us in minutes
where it may take us a year at warp nine to reach."
"You keep using the word, us, are you planning to join us
on our planned journey?" it was Dolittel again.
"I use the word merely as a figure of speech, Sir."
Doctor Cembera answered crisply.Then Continued "We have
implemented the new drives in an older test ship, dubbed the
U.S.S. Fulton.Once again like all technology we're using,
it involves complete replacement of the main systems plus
extensive reworking of other systems.
The results were extremely promising, the Fulton ended up
within the desired sector.There was, however, a bit of a
side effect caused by the worm hole, a great deal of the
outer hull was ruptured in transit.This, however, should
not effect the Vigilante, since the technology has been
refined a great deal and the hull and shield strengths have
been greatly increased.
"Finally, there have been a number of modifications in
the shield generators, weapons, and transporters to make the
Vigilante actually several generations more advanced than
even a Galaxy class Star ship."
"Don't you think your being just a bit over optimistic
with that last statement." Dolittel said as Cembera reclaimed
her seat.
"And" Tarva interjected "do you think only a couple of
generations are enough to defeat the Borg where they live?".
"Allow me to answer that." Captain Anthony said "Our
mission is not to defeat the Borg but rather to collect
extensive information about them in the hope of being able to
defeat them the next time they arrive in our little arm of
the galaxy.Okay, any other questions?"
Captain Anthony and Doctor Cembera began to field
questions about different aspects of the mission and details
of the ship.
During the meeting Commander Tarva examined Commander
Norton.He was a medium sized humanoid a bit shorter then
Captain Anthony but with a solid build.His size was due as
much to genetics as it was to an obvious attempt on his own
part to maintain a highly muscled physique.She could see
highly defined muscles reaching up to his neck, it even
appeared that his face was muscled.His ears were pointed
and his forehead slightly pronounced like a Romulan's.
Tarva's background told her that this man was at least part
Romulan.Her background also told her that the
Romulan/Vulcan traits were extremely dominant and all he
needed was one hiding somewhere in his family tree for him to
show these kind of features.Another oddity about this man
was his totally bald head.It was obvious, at least to her,
that he shaved his head which was not consistent with any
cultures she could readily attribute to him.

----------

Ensign Janice O'Malley piloted the gray Drop Ship through
one of the Tau Epsilon far asteroid fields.Next her sat a
very cocky acting young man in white coveralls named Picback.
They were both properly strapped into their seats but his was
turned slightly and leaned back so he could place his feet up
on an empty area of the control panel."I still don't see
why I'm out here flying this can around."she said "I'm a
navigator not a shuttle pilot."
"First of all, this is not a shuttle or a can." Picback
said with a smile. "It's a highly sophisticated troop drop
ship.Second, from my understanding they don't have much
need for a navigator on the Vig for the time being.Third
all navigators should be trained as pilots and these are the
only things to pilot or navigate for the time being.I guess
their just trying to make you earn your keep."
Just then something besides rock appeared on the
scanners."That must be our target," Picback said "remember,
with the cloaking he can't see us so keep your distance.We
don't want him running into us after dropping off our
package."
From their position they could watch the tug disconnect
from the cargo pod after placing it in close proximity to a
large asteroid.When it lifted away they could clearly read
it's name and number, U.S.S. CHANDRASEKHER NCC-3923-C.Their
sensors told them it was doing an intense sensor sweep of the
area.
"What's he doing that for?" she asked Picback.
"His instructions are very strict,he's not to leave the
cargo if he detects any other activity in the area."He
replied as if extremely bored with the whole process.
Ensign O'Malley continued to track the tug as it
high-tailed it out of the system.Once the tug had entered
warp she began to approach the cargo pod.Picback now sat in
normal position and began to work his own controls.The Drop
Ship slowly approached the giant cargo pod and was soon
dwarfed by it.
"This thing looks longer than the Vigilante" said
O'Malley as she moved ever closer to the pod.
"Well, they were originally designed to haul a couple
Galaxy style warp engines around in, with room to spare.
This should be our last delivery."Picback said as he
powered up the magnetic cargo couplings that had been
retrofitted to the Drop Ship.
"What do you suppose is in it?" Janice asked her
companion trying to make conversation.
"You know the regs," he said with a smile "we're only
allowed to discuss matters directly related to our jobs.I
can make small talk with you about anything to do with a drop
ship or flying one.Believe or not we are even allowed to
discuss details specifically related to any current
assignment."
With this dissertation Janice laughed and said "You could
have just said, 'I don't know'."
The couplings clanged into place slightly jolting the
ship."OKay," Picback said "ease the power up slowly this
tub is a lot more powerful than a wimpy star fleet shuttle
and remember we have a lot more mass now."
"Mr Picback, I am not fresh out of the Academy." Ensign
O'Malley said slightly irritated "I have maneuvered the
Enterprise through an asteroid field on more than on
occasion."
"The Enterprise's deflector shields probably gave you
quite a bit more room for error, huh?" Picback returned just
as they jerked forward. "What was that?"
"Just slipped the accelerator a bit." The Ensign said.
"How can you, slip the accelerator a bit?" Picback said
worryingly "You better let me have control I've done this a
lot more than you have."
"Don't worry." Janice said with a slight grin Picback
didn't notice "I can handle it." and pulled back on the
control stick to start the maneuver to arc them out of the
asteroid field."But you know, it's been quite some time
since I've piloted anything with a control stick."
"Why didn't you tell me before we hooked on to this
monster?" Picback said trying not to show the panic he was
starting to feel.
"I tried to." Janice said "But you said I had to earn my
keep.Now's its too late, huh?" she sounded as if she was
trying not to panic which didn't help Picback's new state
of mind.
A proximity warning began to flash on the scanner
console.Ahead of them they seemed to be about to ram a
rather large orange asteroid.Picback locked his arms and
legs and shut his eyes bracing himself for the collision,
which never occurred.
"What happened?" he said after more than enough time had
passed for them to have hit the asteroid.
"You were right," Ensign O'Malley said with a smile "this
thing does have a lot wider turning radius than I'm used to."
They than passed between two extremely close asteroids as
the proximity warning flashed again.Before Picback had time
to react again, they were clear of the field.
"Whew," Janice said and feigned wiping sweat from her
forehead. "I didn't think we'd make that last one".
All Picback could do was sit there and hope he didn't
draw the red head as a partner again.
The huge cargo pod sped through space with no obvious
means of propulsion as the Drop Ship remained cloaked. When
it approached TE-4 Ensign O'Malley had placed their cargo
into a predetermined orbit.The velocity and orbit had to be
precise inorder to eventually get the pod in a matching orbit
with the space dock.The idea was to place the pod in a high
orbit and brake it down to the matching orbit with the dock.
She had been braking since passing the orbit sphere of TE-5.
Now she had to drop into a high orbit and begin heavy braking
hopefully the space dock would catch up with them as they
reached its orbit.
An untrained observer would have thought the procedure an
easy one.As the cargo pod entered it's high orbit, it began
making increasingly lower orbits over the space dock.
Eventually, the pod just seemed to drop into space over the
space dock.It was then maneuvered into its place in the top
of the framing directly over the Vigilante.
Picback and O'Malley had been gone just over two days and
four hours when they maneuvered their ship into the shuttle
bay.As soon as the ship came to rest, the airlock door flew
open and Picback jumped down, fell to his knees and kissed
the deck.A man in a black crew uniform stood at a nearby
control console watching the scene and looked at Picback as
he walked by.
"Don't ever, ever put me in a ship with her again. She
was doing barrel rolls on our way in." Picback said to the
shuttle bay chief as he passed.
Shuttle bay Chief Taragoma then watched Ensign O'Malley
ride the slowly descending Drop Ship stairs as they lowered
into place.Her combed back short red hair was slightly
messed from the long trip and she carried her uniform jacket
casually over one shoulder.As she walked up to him, she put
her jacket on and fastened it properly.When she reached him
she handed him the ships log.
"What was wrong with your technician, Ensign?" he asked
her.
"I have no idea, Sir, I guess he's a little high strung."
she said with a bit of a smile.
Taragoma checked the log and looked up at the young
woman standing before him."Okay, dismissed" he said.
"Thank you, Sir"
The Chief smiled as he watched her walk out and thought
"I knew we'd have problems with cloaking these things during
routine missions."

----------

Captain Anthony stood in a large, round dimly lit
chamber, around him, workers in their white coveralls went
about their business.The room appeared unfinished, there
were massive connecters and mountings everywhere.There
were, however, no loose wires, everything was large and
solid.In six evenly spaced places on the floor were large
gear shaped areas almost two meters in diameter.The bottom
of these gears consisted of what looked like thousands of
optical connections.The walls were basically smooth except
for sixlarge L shaped channels.
Along one wall area, were four round doors about a meter
and a half in diameter.In the middle of each door was a
sturdy looking wheel for manual opening.The doors were to
escape pods.
The ceiling of the room appeared out of place.It was
not made of the same composite materials of the rest of ship
and seemed laid across the walls rather than built into them.
None of the lighting was a permanent part of the room, it was
all temporary work lighting.Captain Anthony stood to one
side staring at the flat ceiling.
The turbo-lift came up through a hole in the floor.
There were two such turbo lift channels in the room.Both
had a cable net strung across them preventing anybody from
inadvertently stepping into the open hole.The rough out
side of the turbo lift was visible as its single door slid
open.Commander Tarva moved the net aside and walked up to
Captain Anthony.
She stood at attention when she reached him and said
"Captain.".
"Yes." he said in a second, after coming back from his
thoughts.
"Sir, Construction advises that the Bridge is included in
the new shipment." Tarva said.
"Well I'd hope so." Anthony said with a smile "Tell them
to get it installed as soon as possible, a star ship without
a bridge, is like a phaser without a trigger."
Tarva flipped open what looked like an old style
communicator and relayed the Captains orders.They both then
stepped into the turbo lift Tarva had ridden up."Where to
sir?" she asked the captain.
"How long till they expect to start moving the bridge
into place?" Captain Anthony asked before answering her
question.
"They estimate everything should be ready in about six
hours." she said.
"Deck Six." he said to the lift then looked at his time
piece."Commander would you care to join me in supervising
the installation of the U.S.S Vigilante's bridge?" he asked.
"Yes, Sir".
"Meet me at Air Lock Two at 1730 and bring your pressure
suit gear".
"Very good, Sir".She said as he stepped off the lift at
deck six.Commander Tarva then looked at her own time piece,
1230.Five hours, there was nothing pressing needing her
immediate attention.It would be a good time to go back to
the cabin and rest a bit.She had gotten a minimum of rest
since leaving the Enterprise.She did need some.
"Deck eight" she said to the lift.

----------

Tarva sat in her cabin in a short black silken robe with
long sleeves.When sitting, the bottom of the robe seemed to
barely touch the seat of the chair.The black sheathed knife
was still strapped to her right shin and had a few water
droplets on it.Tarva was combing her long wet hair to one
side of her head and down in front of her.She was leaning
forward with legs slightly spread allowing the hair to fall
to the floor between her bare feet.
This is how some of her roommates found her when they
came in.Tarva looked up at them and scowled to herself
"I've got to get my own cabin".
"Commander, we didn't expect you in so soon." said Chief
Swanson.
"Even The First Officer can take some time off once in
awhile." she replied stressing the title."I thought you'd
be working with the new shipment."she said to this whole
group of engineers while still combing her hair.
"That's my intention, Sir." Dolittel said formally as he
broke out his boot liners and other gear for his pressure
suit."The rest, however, are transporter engineers, and
have to wait till we get the bridge out of the way."
Dolittel saw Tarva continue to frown as the others
continued to make themselves comfortable."Perhaps," he said
"They could begin preparing transporter room three to receive
the new chips when ready."
"That sounds like a good idea, Mr Dolittel" Tarva said
finally losing her frown but not smiling.
The others, being greatly out ranked, didn't even
question weather this was an order or a suggestion.They
just picked themselves up and headed back out the door.
"Mr Dolittel," Tarva said as he was about to be the last
to leave.
"Yes, Sir." he said.
"Would you inform all of our roommates that I have no
appointments until 1730." she said curtly and immediately
turned back to brushing her hair.
"1730, yes Sir." he repeated and walked out.

"What did she mean about 1730?" one of his companions
asked Dolittel.
"It means that we can't go back to our own quarters until
then." another one said.
"It means," said Dolittel "that you should find something
to do until 1730."
"And why did you say we could prepare the transporter
room for the new chips?When we've just spent the last
twelve hours doing just that." said Chief Swanson.
"We've got every right to use our own cabin, no matter
who our roommate is.What right does she have to kick us
out.Aren't we suppose to be tolerant until the other cabins
are ready, even the first officer?" said the first.
"You just don't get it." Dolittel said "How long have we
been here?Four days? A little more? How often have you seen
Commander Tarva in the cabin?"
The three just looked at each other and shrugged.
Dolittel continued "I'll tell you, before just now, twice
including the first day.In fact, that bunk hasn't been
touched, I know, remember, I made it and no two people make a
bunk exactly the same way.That means she's been on the go
since we got here and your complaining about twelve hours.
Now I want you to go keep yourselves busy until 1730.After
that you have eight hours to get some rest, because at 0130
hours you are going to begin installing the new transporter
chips.Is that clear?"
"Yes, Sir." they said in unison.
"Very good and first make sure you spread the word to the
other three about 1730."Lt Commander John Dolittel did not
like pulling rank on his team but occasionally, he had to
remind them this was still a military mission.

----------

Smoke filled the bridge and stung Tarva's eyes and lungs
but she recognized the unmistakable cube on the view screen
to her right.Everything began to shake while in the
distance a partially recognizable star ship exploded.A hull
breach alarm sounded and a strong wind began rushing by her.
Tarva looked down at her captain laying in her arms.Blood
poured from his mouth and his chest made a sucking sound
every time he tried to breath.Tarva was backing towards an
open escape pod dragging the Captain with her, just as they
entered the pod a blinding flash blew them against the back
of the pod....
The familiar rhythm of a Kalonian march sounded in
Tarva's head.She sat up in the dark cabin trying to
remember where she was.With her movement the lights came on
just enough to outline the room and the march faded.
As the ghosts cleared Tarva reached for her time piece
and said "Lights, intensity 3. Volume level 5"
The lights came up enough to read the watch and the march
came back up to pleasant thump.She carried an old Kalonian
time piece so she needed light to read it.She then had to
do some quick math to convert to standard.Once again
inconvenienced by human arrogance, they always seemed
convinced that everybody went by Sol-3 time or at least
should.
Tarva smiled, she knew no human thought of their home
planet as Sol-3.Most called it Earth and many not born
there called it Terra.Tarva used Sol-3 because it was the
Federation's generic name for Earth and the class designation
humans used for almost all other planets even those of major
Star Fleet allies.She figured it appropriate that she used
Sol-3 since many seemed insistent in calling Kalon, Antri-4.
It was 1700, just what she had set the alarm for.Tarva
took a load of clean clothes from a drawer and walked into
the head.When she looked in the mirror half her face was
gashed open from above the left eye down her cheek to her
neck and blood pour from the wound...
Tarva sat up in bed totally soaked in sweat screaming.
She sat in the dark cabin trying to remember where she was.
With her movement the lights came on just enough to outline
the room and the march faded.

----------

Commander Tarva met Captain Anthony at Air Lock Two suit
room at precisely 1730.
"Have you gotten much rest since coming aboard?" he asked
her."I know you've been extremely busy."
"I've gotten enough, Sir." she replied as she opened her
bag.
The current version space suit had two main layers the
first was a gray jump-suit with bio-tech connections.It was
worn over the standard tight shorts and tank top under
uniform.The jumpsuit even had built in feet which then fit
into the boot liner.These parts and the glove liners which
attached to the jumpsuit where carried in the bag.
Tarva saw that the captain had noticed her knife which
she had to take off to fit into the jumpsuit.
"You know." he said "General Star Fleet regulations do
not allow personal weapons to be carried while on duty."
"Yes I am aware of the regs, Sir," She said "but there
are also the amendments for preservation of Federation
cultures."
At that his face lit up "Ah yes," he smiled "the Kalonian
Simtar, I should have known." he than held out his hand and
said "May I?"
This was a very presumptuous thing to do.Anybody who
knew about the Kalonian Simtar would know it would only be
voluntarily surrendered to a very close friend or family
member.Traditionally, only parents, children and mates
would be considered 'very close'.
The Captain must have known this, when she handed it to
him, he looked extremely satisfied.He carefully pulled it
from the sheath, just far enough to see the full blade.The
blade's finish was flat black while the edges had been honed
to a bright polished black.One full side was sharpened and
about a third of the other side while the tip curved up
toward the shorter edge.He snapped the blade back into it's
sheath and handed it back to his First Officer.He had it
less than thirty seconds.
"I hear they have become extremely difficult to find even
on Kalon." he said as he activated his suit lowering
mechanism.
"That's true, Sir." Tarva said as she stepped into the
bottom half of her suit."The ebon metal the blade is made
of has become extremely rare.While the demand has
increased.The return to traditionalism has made it
extremely difficult for the families like mine who have
always maintained traditional values."
Anthony had to wait while he lowered his helmet into
place and secured it.He then turned on his intercom and
waited while Tarva's suit was secured.Before putting on the
suit gloves she placed the Simtar in her bag with the rest of
her uniform and placed them in a locker.
While she was doing this Captain Anthony asked "What is
the handle made of?""
Tarva hesitated, this Simtar was old enough to be from
the era when Klingon bone was used.She knew, however, that
it would be best not to let this get around."The handles
have been made from many differant materials through the
years."Tarva finally responded.
"Was it difficult to find?"Anthony continued.
"Actually, Sir," Tarva said "this Simtar was given to my
father by my mother, when she asked him to be her mate.I
inherited both of their Simtars after their bodies were
recovered."
"I'm sorry," Anthony said "I didn't realize. I shouldn't
have brought it up."
Tarva stood up straight, looked at her Captain through
her helmet and said proudly "It is a great honor on Kalon for
mates to die together in battle."
Captain Anthony knew he was digging himself into a hole
so he merely secured his gloves gave her a brief salute and
motioned her toward the air lock.
At the air lock door, they ran systems checks on their
suits.They then checked with Construction Control to
coordinate the vital signs check.Next, they backed into
large white jet packs.Their ship's black suits fit securely
into the construction white space walk packs.
When the outer airlock door opened, Tarva stepped out and
fired the maneuvering jets with the Captain right behind her.
She never really appreciated the size of a star ship till she
walked from one.Down the ship to her right the port warp
drives swept up and down away from the body.The massive
dull gray hull made her feel extremely insignificant, like an
insect.
"Lets go." Captain Anthony said and accelerated to the
cargo pod attached across the top of the upper girders.
Tarva followed without hesitation, it was some minutes
before they reached the top of the pod.They landed on a
black girder and looked toward the pod."This is the last
shipment?" she said more as a statement than a question.
"That's right." Captain Anthony said and pointed to a
large round container being hoisted out of the cargo pod.
The pod's whole top had split down the middle and opened as
two large doors.The round container had been fitted with
several small rockets along the side and was being slowly
lifted from its place.
"And that," he said proudly "is my bridge.There are
also the chips we need to get the transporters operational,
some parts for the anti-matter chambers, and some blocks of
raw hull material."
"It seems there should be more than that in there."
Tarva said just trying to make conversation.
Anthony turned toward her so she could see him smile.
"There is." he said"We are also receiving a shipment of new
space suits and multi-function phasers."
Tarva looked down at what she was wearing and said "I
thought these were the newest model?".
"They are, but they were designed for a peaceful mission,
they are not suitable for us."
Tarva smiled behind her face plate and said "Finally, a
suit designed for a warrior."
"That's right, a warrior on a ship that does not exist
and is crewed by ghosts."
The pair stood over the saucer section looking down into
the open hole they had stood in only hours before.The plate
that had been the roof was now attached to the girders below
them.The bridge was slowly maneuvered into place over the
hole.The channels on the sides of the hole had to match up
perfectly with pegs on the side of the bridge.If all had
been manufactured perfectly this would insure all connections
would fit correctly.
When the bridge was started into the hole and the pegs
rested on the edges the side rockets were removed and rockets
on the top were used to rotate the bridge into place.After
the side pegs came over the proper channels, large clamps
grabbed the pegs and pulled the bridge down into the very
snug fitting hole.When it reached the bottom of the
channels the bridge rotated a meter to lock into place.
Once it was locked in, a systems check was conducted to
test the connections.A collar then expanded from the ship
to seal the slight gap left between the bridge and the ship.
A cap of composite material was then fit over the bridge to
blend it smoothly with the rest of the saucer section.
"Lets go take a look at our bridge." Captain Anthony said
stepping off the girder and accelerating toward the
Vigilante.

"The Shakedown"
....
Have ever you stood where the silences brood,
And vast the Horizons begin,
At the dawn of the day to behold far away
The goal you would strive for and win?
Yet ah! in the night when you gain to the height,
With the vast pool of heaven star-spawned,
Afar and agleam, like a valley of dream,
Still mocks you a land of Beyond.

"THE LAND OF BEYOND"




Commander Tarva and Captain Anthony stood in front of the
turbo lift door waiting to enter the bridge.Commander Tarva
spoke into her communicator with Construction while waiting for
the bridge to be pressurized.When life support was established
the turbo lift door opened.
Captain Anthony and Commander Tarva were alone when they
stepped onto the bridge.Only the emergency lights shining down
from hidden recesses illuminated the bridge.The major color
scheme was gray with black accents.There seemed to be more
chairs then expected, all tightly wrapped in plastic.
Before they could make it half way around the bridge turbo
lift two opened allowing the construction crew in.They
immediately crawled under the control banks and opened other
panels.Slowly, computer screens began to light up and the main
lights came on showing the whole bridge.
Tarva and Captain Anthony without saying a word to each
other began tearing the plastic off the chairs.Each station
had a chair and was well designed for total access.The current
trend in star ship bridges was to have several stations as
standing positions, no chairs available.In the Vigilante this
could cause a problem if they ever actually tried to use the
controlled worm hole effect.
The chairs had high backs with emergency restraints and
belts.The bridge had the standard layout with Captain in the
middle of the Bridge.Pilot and Navigator in front of and to
either side of the Captain.Next to the Captain on the left was
the Security station.On the other side of the Captain was the
First Officer station.The five stations in the middle of the
bridge each had a wrap around counsel.The Captain's chair also
had special controls on the restraint arms.The Captain and
First Officer's consoles were designed mainly for ship wide
communications they could also be quickly reconfigured for all
other bridge functions.
Tarva tried her chair out for size.The cloth seatseemed
to form to fit.The worker laying under her console stood up
and pushed a button on it.The console lit up and Tarva
recognized it as a standard console with emphasis on
communications.
She pushed a button and said "Attention, all bridge crew
please report to the bridge."

As the last of the Bridge shifts showed up, the last of the
workers was leaving.More than fifteen people stood on the
front of the bridge in front of the main view screen.Many
appeared to have been gotten out of bed, they were yawning and
didn't have perfectly groomed hair.
Captain Anthony sat in his chair and waited while First
Officer Tarva did a roll call of the crew before him.Behind
him, stood Chief Engineer Dolittel and Chief of Security Norton.
"Sir, all present." Tarva said and took her seat next to
him.
The Captain stood up and said "Welcome to the bridge of the
U.S.S. Vigilante.Until now the only bridge we've had use of
has been the incomplete emergency bridge.
"Your next project will be to start running total
diagnostics on your stations.You will also be responsible for
absolute knowledge of your station.Your next mission will be
to form a working knowledge of all other stations plus an in
depth knowledge of at least one other related station.I want
this bridge busy until we launch.In three days we will begin
running simulations.You have until then to at least start
learning your stations.
"One more thing, Lieutenant Commander Dolittel." Anthony
said and turned to face him.
"Yes, Sir." Dolittel said coming to attention.
"I have decided that because the Vigilante has a high
average command rank, the position of Chief Engineer should be
held by someone with a grade higher than Lieutenant Commander."
Anthony paused and watched Dolittel squirm a bit then continued.
"As you all may remember, the standing policy is to maintain
rank utill the end of the mission.This leaves me in an awkward
position since I do not wish one of my most important positions
to be occupied by a light commander.I have two choices either
second guess one of my policies or second guess my First
Officer."
He stepped toward Dolittel and said "I'm sorry," he paused
"I cann't second guess my First Officer, congratulations
Commander Dolittel."Captain Anthony finally smiled and shook
Dolittel's hand.
"Thank you, Sir." Dolittel said, for once at a loss for
words.
Captain Anthony turned back toward the crew and checked his
time "It appears to be time for the third shift, the rest are
dismissed."
Short, to the point meetings seemed to be Captain Anthony's
style.The crew would have to get used to being pulled out bed
for meetings and other whims of the Captain.


Tarva was the first after the Captain to congratulate
Commander Dolittel.She then said "I have some more good news
for you.It's time to move."Tarva then reached over to a
nearby computer console and punched up a ships diagram.
"Finally." Dolittel said with a wide smile.
"I have assigned the newly finished section here by
engineering to you and all of your personnel.It will be your
responsibility to assign quarters."
Dolittel looked at the diagram and said "They're all
doubles, surly there is enough room on this ship to give the 200
crew here their own billets."
"Actually there are two singles in the section I have
assigned to you.As for the rest of the available housing we
are expecting more crew to transfer after the first space
trials.In fact, the bunk rooms we have been staying in will be
mostly for their use."
"You mean they finished the rooms we didn't need first, what
were they thinking?"
"They were thinking that it would take almost half the time
to get a fewer number of larger quarters ready. Thus allowing us
to board earlier."
Tarva then smiled and said "Now if you'll excuse me, I have
some packing to do."

-----------

Tarva's new quarters were near the middle of the saucer
section near the Captain's.They were small compared to any
officer quarters on the Enterprise.There were two 'rooms'
separated by slight dividers.Tarva wearing her black robe sat
cross legged in the middle of the bed staring at the mirror on a
near by wall.She was not looking at her self but reflecting on
the nightmares that had been plaguing her.
When the explosion on the Eclipse threw her and the Captain
into the escape pod it had ripped her face open.She barely had
the strength to hit the eject mechanism before the final
explosion ripped the Eclipse apart.The Captain's body had
protected her from most of the explosion but left her trapped in
the escape pod with it.She then drifted for several days
before being picked up by the New Aukland.
When she was rescued, she was unconscious and stayed that
way for quite sometime.Her face was bandaged and she was
extremely weak when she finally woke.
The realization she was the only survivor still plagued her.
As chief of security, it was her duty to do all she could to
protect the crew of the Eclipse.She knew they were up against
an irresistible force and that the destruction of the Eclipse
was not her fault.The honor bred into a Kalonian warrior,
however, haunted her every night.She was being torn apart by
the loss of her ship and the honor of returning the war to the
Borg.

-----------

Commander Norton watched First Officer Tarva approach the
entrance to the cargo bay.It had been several hours since the
meeting on the bridge.Tarva had expressed interest in the
shipment of the new pressure suits.Now that he was about to
start putting them together she wished to be present.
First Officer, Commander Sashon Tarva was an interesting
colleague.After his arrival on the Vigilante Commander Tarva
had approached him about his position.She said that she knew
that he was much more qualified for First Officer.The Captain,
however, was under the impression that he had no aspiration for
a higher position and would much prefer Chief of Security.If
the Captain were mistaken, Commander Tarva said that she would
talk to him about correcting the error.Norton had no desire
for any higher command position, his goals were different than
most Star Fleet officers.

"Sir," Commander Norton said when Tarva arrived "My crew has
begun assembling the first pressure suits."
"Very good, Commander." Tarva said "Lets have a look".
When they entered the cargo bay, they found it filled with
shipping containers.Several stood open while black uniformed
security and engineering crew pieced together several pressure
suits.
The suits like all other aspects of the ship had an
unfamiliar design.Instead of the standard ribbed design they
had flat almost armor like panels on the chest and back.All
panels were solid instead of flexible ribs.They also had very
pronounced hinged joints.
Commander Tarva had expected the suits to be black to match
the current color scheme of all the other uniforms.These
suits, however, where a dull gray like the hull of the ship.
Tarva walked around one of the suits, looked at Norton and
said "They look like something out of the dark ages."
"They are." came a voice from the cargo bay door.
"Sir." Tarva and Norton said together, it was Captain
Anthony.
"As you said, we needed pressure suits for warriors."
Anthony said as he walked up to them."The NM-1's are more than
pressure suits, they are suits of armor."
The Captain turned to one of the crew and said "Is one of
these completed?"
The crewman pointed to one of the suits hanging on a
shipping container.
"Have you completed complete systems diagnostics on it?"
"It was the first thing we did before unpacking any of the
other suits, Sir" was the reply.
Anthony than turned to Norton and said "Your phaser
please."
Without hesitation Commander Norton handed the Captain his
phaser.Captain Anthony then made a point of showing everybody
he was setting it to maximum power.This would be enough to
vaporize just about anything smaller than a standard shuttle.
"Stand back" he said and poured an extended beam into the
suit.The suit and container jumped back from the force of the
blast.Heat poured from the suit and the cargo container
buckled from it.All present had to cover their eyes and faces
from the heat and bright red glow.
The heat subsided quickly but the cargo container continued
to glow.Anthony turned to one of the technicians and said "Run
a new diagnostics on it.I also want to see a copy of its
internal atmospheric record."
"Aye, Sir." said the crewman and pulled out a special NM-1
diagnostics tricorder which had come with the new suits.
After a couple of minutes of running the diagnostics the
crewman said "All systems check out in perfect working order."
The atmospheric report showed that the temperature inside
the suit had risen a total of 10 degrees Celsius during the
phaser blast.It might have been uncomfortable but it wouldn't
have been harmful.
"These suits are made of a similar material as the hull of
The Vigilante." Captain Anthony said giving the phaser back to
Norton."The material is different than our hull, it has a much
denser cell structure and disperses much more energy as heat.
The reason our hull is not made of it is that it takes ten times
the current hull material to make the suit material.To protect
even more the suits also have built in deflector shields."
Anthony then pointed to the life support pack."The NM-1
suits have an extended life support range of up to five days.
They have built in maneuvering jets, they're suppose to be even
better than the space walk packs we use now."
Commander Norton decided to speak up "If these suits are
made of basically the same material as the hull does that mean
that scanners will not penetrate them?"
Captain Anthony smiled and said "So they tell me, anybody
want to find out?"
With very little discussion it was decided that Commander
Norton should be the first to try on the new suit.It took a
while to configure a suit to fit him, but it would have to be
done eventually.After suiting up he walked around and tested
the joints.The suit fit extremely snug on him, but this was to
compensate for vacuum of space.
"This isn't to bad" he said "It's much lighter then the
standard suit."He than began studying the control panels on
one of his lower arms where's the cloaking button?" he said with
a wide grin.
"They weren't able to reduce the circuitry to install in the
suit by shipping time."Anthony replied seriously.
"You mean they were trying to cloak our pressure suits too?
They really were pulling out all of the stops." Tarva said.
"Actually if you want to be precise these pressure suits are
not intended for the large portion of the crew currently on the
Vigilante." Captain Anthony said."The only ones who will be
issued the NM-1 are command staff and security.The rest will
be issued to the new crew we will be picking up after the space
trials have begun."
He turned back to Commander Norton and said lets check the
standard tricorder readings.The crewman with NM-1 diagnostic
tricorder replaced it with a standard tricorder.After Norton
put on the helmet and lowered the face shield the crewman
started walking around him.
The tricorder made it's usual buzzing and whirling sounds,
after a few minutes he said "The tricorder doesn't even pickup
the suit's energy pack.It does, however, show a smaller solid
object like a rock of indeterminate make up, about a meter
high."
Almost a meter was cut off Norton's height.All present
were extremely impressed.
"Now lets take a look at the new phasers..." Anthony said
and headed to a differant set of containers.
They were breaking into the phaser boxes when Commander
Doittel and Doctor Cembera hailed Captain Anthony.They
announced that the ship's cloaking was available for testing.
Captain Anthony agreed, he thought it was also a good time to
run scanner tests on the Vigilante.
"Commander Tarva, have the scanner prepared Drop Ship
readied for a mission in two hours." Captain Anthony said.

-----------

The Drop Ship swung around to face the Vigilante in its
space dock.Ensign O'Malley had become the resident D S pilot.
She still insisted she was a Star Ship navigator, not a Drop
Ship pilot.Nevertheless, here she sat with Captain Anthony
sitting in the co-pilot's seat the First Officer standing behind
him and the Chief of security standing behind her.It was
enough to make even the most experienced Drop Ship pilot(if
there was one) nervous.
Captain Anthony was busily working the scanners that had
been installed for this exercise.He looked up and smiled, "I
read this side of the space dock structure without problem" he
reported."I can count every soul in Construction offices and
housing.The structure on the far side of the ship appears to
be fuzzy.From the scanners I would say that a small tug size
vessel may be in dock.I, however, do not read any life forms
on the vessel."
Commander Tarva smiled and said "A standard tug is less than
a quarter the mass of the Vigilante and only has two warp
engines.Currently there are over two hundred crew and
construction personnel on the Vigilante."
Tarva then pulled her oversized communicator out of one of
her pockets and said "Engage cloaking."
"Acknowledged" came back Dolittel's voice.
The Vigilante shimmered a bit and disappeared.The girders
on the far side of the ship became visible.The only odd part
were the few supports connecting the Vigilante with space dock,
they seemed to be cut off at mid point.
Captain Anthony spoke up with an update from the scanners
"Scanners now show no presence of the Vigilante and clearly
define the whole space dock.This is going to be a very
interesting mission."

-----------

The dull gray Vigilante hung in the black girders of it's
space dock backed by the turbulent orange of TE-4.On one of
the girders stood a lone figure in a gray pressure suit similar
in color to the ship.All four warp engines glowed blue from
testing.
Captain Anthony hadn't had time to look at his ship since
the crew boarded.It was now two months later and this may be
the last time he would see the Vigilante from the outside.They
were scheduled to begin space trials today.After leaving space
dock they would not return to the Tau-Epsilon system, any
problems that came up they were required to fix on their own.
Because of this policy, all systems were being meticulously
checked before the trials began.
"Preparing to release supports." came a voice from
Construction Control.
"Acknowledged" Anthony said as he stepped off the girder and
fired his maneuvering controls "Vigilante, engage stabilizer
engines."
"Aye, Aye, Sir." replied Commander Tarva.
As Anthony came down over the top starboard warp drive he
could see the relatively small stabilizer rockets begin firing
while the supports from space dock were released.The
stabilizer rockets were computer controlled to keep the
Vigilante in a relatively fixed position.In this case the
fixed position was in relation to the space dock.
"Commander Dolittel, what is our earliest estimated time of
departure." Anthony said to his suit's communicator when he
entered the air lock.
"I can have us ready for departure in six hours" said
Dolittel almost immediately.
"You have two." said Anthony with a smile.
"I think we may be able to pull that off." was Dolittel's
smart reply.
Captain Anthony knew that John Dolittel seemed to always
tripled his actual estimates.Dolittel had said he started it
when he was in the Academy just to give himself room for error.
He than found that it made himself and his team look good when
they came in under their estimated times.Now he just did it
out of habit, it had just become expected of him.

-----------

Captain Anthony sat in his place on the bridge in front of
him to his right sat the red headed Ensign O'Malley who was
Picard's contribution to his crew.Picard had made a good
choice in this one, she not only was a highly qualified
navigator but had proven herself a fine Drop Ship pilot.She
also had something in common with many of her fellow crew, she
had a personal interest in the Borg.
Ensign O'Malley's father, Doctor Peter O'Malley was killed
when the Borg destroyed his ship.With eleven thousand
personnel killed and nearly forty star ships destroyed the one
encounter with a Borg ship touched all members of Star Fleet
personally one way or another.
Captain Anthony reflected on how many of his crew came to be
on the Vigilante because of that one battle with the Borg.
Commander Tarva was the lone survivor of the Eclipse, Ensign
O'Malley lost her only family, and many others qualified for the
no family, no attachments, provisions of the mission for the
same reason.
As he sat waiting for the launching of the United Star Ship
Vigilante, Captain Anthony felt extreme satisfaction.He too
met all requirements of the mission thanks to the one battle
with the Borg and Locutus.His last command the USS Nielsen was
destroyed in the battle.He had been on Star Base A-6
recovering from a sever bout of Anturi Flu.The medical
facilities on the Nielsen had not been adequate for his
recovery.The Nielsen had just docked at Star Base and
transferred him to it's infirmary when the call came.The
Nielsen was to join the armada in a last ditch stand against the
Borg.
Captain Anthony was unconscious the whole time until the
Nielsen was destroyed.When all life on the Nielsen ended,
Anthony woke up screaming.They told him he screamed for an
hour after waking.The reports of the defeat at Wolf-359 had
not yet reached Star Base A-6.In fact, Anthony was not aware
he wasn't on the Nielsen.The news of the destruction of the
Nielsen dropped him into a shock induced comma.With the death
of the Nielsen his life ended too.His wife, lover, best friend
was also his First Officer.She was in command in his absence,
she would have faced the Borg in his place.She had died
without him by her side as they had always promised each other.
After waking from the comma his hair started to come in gray.
Now just a few years later his jet black hair was almost all
gray.
After the destruction of the Nielsen, Captain Robert Anthony
lost all desire to have anything to do with Star Fleet.He
moved to the pioneer planet, Infiniti West and settled down to a
life of isolation.
Infiniti West was a colony planet with an environment
similar to earth.During the early days of colonization,
Infiniti West was settled by a group that spurned all
technology.Their goal was to establish a colony based on the
pioneer life style of 18th century North America.Infiniti
West's varied climates made it ideal for adventurers.From
seemingly endless tracks of ancient forests to expansive hostile
deserts to mountain ranges that made anything on Earth look
puny.Infiniti West had something for everyone.
There was a small Star Fleet station in orbit and some
inconspicuous forts, that helped control visitors to the planet.
Their main function was as base stations for scientists studying
Infiniti West's immense ecology.
Robert Anthony lived in a small stone dwelling he found in
the high mountain region of the main continent.The cabin was
just below the mountain's tree line.In the foot hills was a
small trading post catering to the local trappers and home
stedders.For over a year he lived alone seeing only an
occasional trapper.
His solitude ended when he came back from a hunting trip to
find two Star Fleet officers examining his cabin.One was a
taller bearded man but the other gave away who they were, the
gold skinned android, Data, was the signature of the Enterprise.
"Captain Robert Anthony?" said the android.
Anthony dropped the carcass of a six legged furry animal
onto a stone table in his yard.Then jumped down from his
horse.The horse whinnied and backed a few steps from Data.
Horses had been scattered through out the stars from Earth and
they still seemed to know when something wasn't natural.
"Captain is a Star Fleet title," Anthony said as he began to
walk the horse to it's carrel. "and Robert is what my wife
called me."
"I'm William T. Riker First Officer of the U.S.S.
Enterprise." said the bearded man "This is Mr Data".
Anthony put the horse in it's carrel and began removing the
saddle.He turned to the two officers and said curtly "What do
you want with me?"
Mr Data began relating their story, it turned out they had
been searching Infiniti West for several months.A team had
finally been able to locate him when they found the small
trading post and heard of a loner in the mountains every one
called, Star Fleet.
Thus began the drawn out negotiations as they tried to
convince him to return to Star Fleet.The Enterprise had
already spent two months in orbit around Infiniti West with many
teams looking for him.They now seemed quite intent on not
leaving until he agreed to come with them.After more than two
weeks he rode his horse to the trading post, where he gave his
few possessions to the only person he thought of as a friend,
the merchant he did most of his business with.
Riker, dressed in the local style outfit he had worn during
the search met him at the trading post.Together they beamed up
to the Enterprise and Robert Anthony rejoined the elite rank of
Star Fleet Captains.

-----------

"Captain, this is engineering, we're ready any time you
are." It was Dolittel in his usual informal manner.
"Construction Control," Captain Anthony said "the USS
Vigilante is ready to leave the nest."
"It's been a wonderful experience" came Doctor Cembera's
voice in reply.

Doctor Cembera stood in Construction Control.She watched
as the Vigilante slowly moved out from under her.It had a
preset course of test maneuvers to run while leaving the system.
They had to make sure all the bolts were tight before trying the
warp drives.Once they were out of the Tau-Epsilon system
though, they would never return.Doctor Cembera had a tear in
her eye as if watching an only child go off to war.
"Doctor," came a voice from beside her.
"Yes."
"Memory Alpha reports they are ready to begin shipping the
hulks you requested."
Doctor Cembera continued to watch the Vigilante slide
silently away then said "Tell them to proceed."

-----------

The trip out of the Tau Epsilon system was an anti-climax.
After so many hours of work few even knew they had even gotten
under way.The ship performed flawlessly during the maneuvers
through the system.
Before entering warp, Captain Anthony ordered the cloaking
engaged.It was standard operating procedure that the Vigilante
run cloaked.It would not do for anybody to get a look at her
while she remained 'Top Secret'.The trip through the Tau
Epsilon system would be the only time they would run uncloaked,
while the cloaking was functional.For the cloaking to function
the deflector shields only needed to be at 10% power.
"Set course to Predetermined Test Coordinates three."
Anthony said.
"Aye" Ensign O'Malley said while entering the course.
"Warp one, engage."
"Warp one engaged" said the middle aged human sitting in the
Helmsman's seat.
"Engineering, how are we doing?"
"I thought we were going to test this thing." said Dolittel
"Not just push her about."
"Warp five, engage" Anthony said.
"Warp five engaged" returned the Helmsman.
There was no obvious difference between sitting in space
dock and traveling at warp five except the view screen no longer
showed TE-4 below them but the standard 'rushing stars' opticle
illusion of warp.
The Vigilante spent the next week testing the engines for
extended periods of time below warp 9.6.Finally, Captain
Anthony decided it was time to test the Vigilante's acceleration
to warp 9.6 from sub warp.
"Sir, all hands report ready for acceleration test."
Commander Tarva reported.
Once again Captain Anthony didn't expect to notice anything
special when they jumped to high warp.He couldn't help but
wonder if they might sense something.
"Sir, test coordinates set for warp 9.6 acceleration test."
Ensign O'Malley said.
"Warp 9.6, engage" Captain said.
"Warp 9.6 engaged." replied the helmsman than immediately
reported "Current velocity, warp 9.6"
Anthony thought he felt a slight acceleration but nothing
substantial.They achieved warp 9.6 almost instantly and the
Vigilante didn't seem to be effected in any way.
"Engineering, hold current velocity and begin complete
diagnostic tests, on engines, all systems and ship's
structures." Captain Anthony said then headed to the command
room.
Anthony immediatly began preparing a sub-space transmission
to a small colony world near the Romulan Neutral Zone.

-----------

"Captain Anthony, Sir" came Dolittel's voice over the
intercom.
"Anthony here"
"All tests complete, the Vigilante has held warp 9.6 for
seven hours with no adverse effects."
"Very good, prepare to come out of warp."
Captain Anthony walked back onto the bridge, his crew was
busy running continuous high warp test."Helm, bring us out of
warp."
"Aye, Sir".
"Ensign O'Malley, Plot the best possible course to the
Romulan Neutral Zone, sector 5876.34."
Ensign O'Malley pushed a few buttons on her panel. Then said
"Course plotted ,Sir."
"At warp 9.6 what would be the estimated time of travel?"
Ensign O'Malley pushed a few more buttons and said "Two
weeks, three days two hours, eighteen minutes.."
"Very good," Captain Anthony said and took his seat."Set
new course as plotted, warp nine, engage."
"Ensign O'Malley on present course what would be the
estimated time of arrival using controlled worm hole effect?"
Ensign O'Malley turned to a second console that appeared
tacked on to her normal console.After pushing several buttons,
looking at the display and repeating she said "If we are able to
cancel the Worm hole after exactly two minutes 43 point 7676543
seconds we should emerge in sector 5876.34."
Anthony thought a second and said "How long is that figure
good for?"
"Sir, taking into account our current speed and the size of
sector 5876.43, about 2 minutes.After that the fractional
seconds would begin making a significant difference."
"Recalculate the timing for fifteen minutes from now and
feed it to my station."Anthony had configured his console to
control the worm-hole effect along with helm and navigation.
He then pushed the worm hole warning alarm.A loud claxon
began blaring from the ship wide intercom.Another button shut
the claxon off on the bridge.The view screen began showing a
count down to the controlled worm hole.The bridge crew began
strapping themselves into their seats for the first time.While
all over the bridge on duty and off duty personnel took their
own seats.Many crew had been woke out of comfortable beds not
knowing what was going on.
The view screens in each cabin announced the planned
maneuvere.Each cabin also came equipped with Rough Duty chairs
usually built into a wall as part of the decor.All chairs had
occupant sensors activated during the worm hole warning.The
computer was able to report when all personnel were accounted
for.
"Controlled worm hole count down initiated." Captain Anthony
said almost sarcastically after shutting the bridge claxon off.
As Commander Tarva watched the count down approach zero she
couldn't help but think this could be their actual first step to
meet the Borg or it could all end right now.
"Shields at Maximum." she heard Commander Norton report just
before she saw the view screen rush at her.It felt as if she
was being crushed on a high gravity planet.She could feel her
seat begin to wrap around her and heard a female voice begin to
scream.In front of her Ensign O'Malley bucked against the
restraints and belts, it must of been her screaming.Other
voices began to fill her head as the rest of the bridge crew
joined the chorus of screams.She watched Ensign O'Malley start
screaming in pain and soon heard the new female voice.Tarva
realized that she must have heard her own voice to begin with.
As the count down on the view screen approached the shut
down point Tarva thought she could feel the ship bump or shift a
little.The ship seemed to begin to fall away from her.She
felt like she was alternately hanging from the restraint belts
and being pushed back into the chair.The timer on the view
screen counted passed the set shut down point.
The Vigilante seemed to tumble end over end through the worm
hole it's own warp drives had created.The effect was no longer
controlled by the Vigilante.Tarva knew something was wrong by
the change in the felt effect and tried to reach for her own
controls which proved at first quite elusive.
After bringing up helm station she began issuing shut down
and stabilization commands to the drive systems.Nothing seemed
to have any effect, finally, she started desperate maneuvers
including reverse warp.Anything to break out of the worm hole.
When the Vigilante finally broke out,the crew blacked out.
Tarva woke to the sound of a moaning bridge crew.The view
screen showed 3 minutes 22 seconds of worm hole effect.The
other members were slowly regaining conciseness.Tarva
unbuckled the straps and opened her restraints.Ensign O'Malley
was already standing and stretching.
Captain Anthony hit his intercom and said "Engineering,
Dolittel what the hell happened to us?"
"Unknown, we're trying to determine that out now, Sir. "
Dolittel said groggily.
Tarva saw Ensign O'Malley punching buttons on her console.
"Ensign O'Malley, report what is our present location?"
"According to the Star Charts we're well within the
Romulan Empire."
"I was afraid of that." the Captain muttered.
"Bridge this is Engineering."
"Go ahead" Tarva said.
"Sir we'll have to shut down all power to shields and
engines so we can effect repairs to number three warp engine"
"Commander Dolittel we are in the middle of the Romulan
Empire we may be needing the warp drives and shields.Do we
currently have shields and cloaking?"
"Yes sir, shields are at 40 percent and cloaking is
activated."
"Do we have maneuvering capabilities?"
"Engines one and two are on line engine four will remain
inoperative until engine three comes back on line.Our current
sustainable top speed is warp 7 and the so called 'controllable
worm hole' is inoperative."
"Ensign O'Malley, at warp 7 how long will it take to get to
our original destination?" Anthony said turning to his
navigator.
The Ensign punched a few buttons and reported "Five weeks,
three days ".
"and Warp 9.6?"
Ensign O'Malley reentered her figures and said "One week
five days."
"Engineering, what is the estimated time for repairs and
corrections to warp coil?"
"We should be able to do it in three days." was Dolittel's
reply.
Anthony thought for a bit and said to his first officer "If
we commence with these repairs we're going to need some place to
hide.We don't want to be hanging in the middle of Romulan
territory with all systems off line.No matter how well our
hull protects us from sensors."
"Agreed, Sir, What do you have in mind." Tarva Said.
"Since the Romulans may have detected our worm hole this may
not be the best place to hang out.Ensign O'Malley is there an
uninhabited star system in this area?"
"Sir, sensors show two systems in this sector, our records
of Romulan space are not detailed enough to give specific
habitation information.One system, however, is a red dwarf
star and it is very unlikely there would be any colonies there
but there may be a science outpost."
"Set course for the red dwarf system"
"Course plotted and set" O'Malley said immediately.
"At warp 7 what is our ETA?"
"two days seven hours twenty three minutes, Sir"
"Sir," Commander Norton interrupted "Romulan war bird
uncloaking about ten kilometers off port bow."
"Have they seen us?" Tarva asked.
"Not yet, they're apparently here to investigate the worm
hole.They are doing intensive sensor sweeps of the area.
Weapons are unarmed and shields are at a minimum."
Tarva looked at the image Norton had put up on the screen.
"If they were able to get here that fast we must be in a heavily
travel sector."
"Agreed," Anthony said "set course to red dwarf system full
impulse.Lets put a little distance between us before going to
warp.We don't know how good their motion detectors are. Engage
"Engineering"
"Commander Dolittel here."
"Commander, we will be in position for you to effect your
repairs in about three days"
"Very good, Dolittel out."
Anthony then turned to Commander Norton "Have they spotted
us yet?"
"Not yet sir, the war bird is still directing sensors at the
area of the worm hole exit."
"Very good, Helm, warp 7, engage".
The Vigilante jumped to warp seven and headed toward the red
dwarf.

There were no research stations or other habitats in the
system.There were several small planets and a gas giant, the
vigilante dropped into a close orbit around the giant and tried
to hide in its electromagnetic aura.
Engineering crawled into the warp engines to fix the bad
coil and test the other three.The rest of the crew began
running extensive diagnostics of all systems.
Commander Tarva's aversion to sleep began to catch up with
her.Captain Anthony ordered her to her cabin until the warp
drives were back on line.He made it quite clear that she was
not to return to the bridge unless ordered there.
Tarva was wearing the under uniform shorts and tank top
while exercising in her cabin.She had set up several gadgets
for more efficient exercise.A chin-up bar was stretched
between the room dividers and a slanted sit-up board was in her
front room.Her hair was rolled in to a bun at the back of her
head and she was soaked with sweat.This is how Commander
Norton found her when he came to visit.
"Your suppose to be resting." he said as she wiped sweat
from her high forehead.
She looked around the room and said "I am relaxing."
then went into the head.
"I don't think this is what the Captain had in mind." Simon
said as he dropped into one her chairs.Because of their
similar experiences they had become fast friends.
Simon heard Tarva taking a shower and had time to reflect on
the circumstances which brought him here.He had spent his
childhood on a planet called Hellguard.It was a planet the
Romulans occasionally dumped their half breed children born of
captives.He was approximately twenty when he was found as an
emaciated stow away on a pirate freighter that had visited
Hellguard.They put him to work as slave labor and it took him
nearly two years to escape to a Federation colony.
His first task was to create a new life.He started by
picking a new name.He decided a human name would be as fresh a
beginning as he could get.After many years he was finally able
to work his way to Earth and petition to the Academy for a
scholarship.Thanks to the long life associated with being half
Volcan and half Romulan he was not considered too old.
He was finally content, after years of hopping from ship to
ship he was finally on the most powerful Star Ship Star Fleet
had ever conceived.
Tarva came out from her shower wearing her short black robe
and her wet hair tied up in a towel.She sat cross legged on
her bed and said "How are the repairs coming?"
"Commander Dolittel reports that the repairs are coming
along on schedule.We should be able to continue the tests of
the Vigilante in a day or so."
"Very good we have a lot to do before we can embark on our
mission.Has there been any more signs of Romulans in the
area?"
"We've been keeping a constant passive scanner watch since
taking the shields and warp drives off line.There has been no
sign of activity in this area."
"This all seems too easy."
"The right equipment can make a difficult job seem easy."
Tarva smiled at this cliche, Simon seemed to like cliches.
She responded with her own "Yes but sometimes when things seem
to be going right something has got to go wrong."
They both laughed at their exchange, Norton then got
serious.
"Sashon," very few people knew her personal name and fewer
yet would ever use it, "you haven't been sleeping much since
coming on board, we all know it, is there anything I can do to
help?"
Tarva sat up stiff "A Kalonian does not need as much sleep
as other members of the Federation." she said proudly.
Simon was not impressed, he seldom was, "You haven't
answered my question.From one suspicious personality to
another, something is wrong, you can't hide it from me.I know
you too well".
Tarva made a point of looking at her time piece and
announced "It is time for me to sleep, we can finish this
conversation at a later date."
Knowing he was at a bulk head he stood bowed slightly from
the hips and walked out.
Tarva assumed her cross legged meditation position.It did
not give her the absolute rest every body eventually needed.It
did, however, give her some rest and the dreams didn't come.

...Tarva lay in the escape pod barely conscious.She could
see out of her right eye but only barely.She could feel a
weight laying across her.With great effort she managed to pull
herself out and look down at it.The remains of her Captain
still lay partially on her.His black skin was barely
recognizable through the blood and lacerations.Most of the
front of the body had taken the force of the explosion that had
thrown them into the pod.Much of the flesh and muscle had been
blackened from the blast.
As she looked at it, the body shuddered and took a labored
breath.It's eye opened and the burned skull turned to look at
her.The remains of its mouth and jaw struggled to form words.
"You failed." it gasped "The ship is destroyed your Captain
and crew are dead.How is it that you managed to save your
self?A Kalonian putting herself ahead of her comrades who
depended her?Who do you think you are?Do you think you
really deserve to live?" It had been edging toward her and
grabbed her face.It started pulling her towards it, with what
was left of it's mouth dangling open.
Tarva woke thrashing and screaming she was totally soaked in
sweat.She could still feel hands on her face and screamed even
louder.
She could feel words in her mind telling her to be calm.
She was safe and nothing could hurt her.She could still feel
the hands touching her face but now it was calming.She thought
she could even see her own face with light skinned hands on it.
The nightmare had turned to a dream she could relax and let her
muscles loosen.Finally she felt safe enough to open her eyes
and see what was real.
Commander Norton sat above her, his bald head accented by
his pointed ears.His hands had been the ones she had felt.He
pulled his hands away and looked into her eyes.
"How do you feel?" he said.
"What happened?"
"I wasn't gone more than twenty paces when I came back in to
ask you something.You had already fallen into a dream,
nightmare.As soon as I touched you, you started screaming.I
only had time to use a mind meld to calm you as you came out of
it."
"Every time," Tarva finally admitted "I fall a sleep the
dreams of the Eclipse's destruction return.They change,
they're becoming more vivid, more twisted.Scenes that would
normally not bother me are scaring me like I've never known.
I've become frightened of sleep, a Kalonian warrior afraid of
her bed.What have I become?"
"You need to resolve the guilt you feel of being the only
survivor of the Eclipse." Norton said. "I don't know if I can
help you with that.It is something you must admit to yourself
and cope with it.I can, however, use the mind-meld to perhaps
help you sleep better.Are you willing to let me try?"
Tarva thought for a second then looked down at the black
robe plastered to her body with sweat."I'll try." she said.
She then got up and went into her bathroom.He could see
her open the robe and drop it off her arms as she disappeared
around the corner.
When Tarva returned she was wearing a robe the same design
as the black one only a dark red.She still wore the Simtar on
her right shin.It occurred to him that he had been extremely
lucky she hadn't reached for it when she woke from the
nightmare.
Tarva got into her bed, for the first time in a long time
under the blanket.Commander Norton sat in a chair next to her
and lightly touched the sides of her head as if massaging the
temples.
As she drifted into sleep he assured her the dreams were an
illusion.This time with his comfort the dreams stayed away.
He could keep the dreams from her, the guilt she would have to
work out on her own.He did, however, plant suggestions to keep
the fear away.Without the terror she had been experiencing
with the nightmares, she would be able to sleep.

Tarva woke to the piping sound on her intercom and Captain
Anthony paging her.She sat up and looked around her.
Commander Norton was long gone.Her red robe was tangled into
the covers of her bed, all she wore was the Simtar and sheath
strapped to her leg.How long she had been a sleep she had no
idea but she felt totally refreshed.
"Commander Tarva here." she said as she stood and stretched.
"Please report to the bridge, immediately."
"Aye, Sir."
Tarva looked at her time piece and tried to remember what
time it was when she kicked Simon out the first time.By her
calculations she must have been asleep over fifteen hours.
When Tarva arrived on the bridge she hadn't taken the time
to brush and braid her hair as normal.Instead it lay rather
unruly on the top of her head and a long pony tail tied in
several places hung down her back.
On the view screen was a distant shot of an uncommon Romulan
ship.Tarva took her seat next to the Captain studied the image
for a few seconds and said "What is it?"
"It appears to be a Romulan research vessel of some kind."
Commander Norton said."It came out of warp uncloaked several
minutes before we started paging you."
"What's its projected course?"
"That's why we've gotten the bridge crew together."Anthony
said "Its current trajectory will put it in orbit around this
planet in about an hour"
Tarva checked the current ship's configuration.The shields
and engines were still off line.The blast shields were shut to
help reduce the Vigilante's sensor profile.
"Are we going to go into silent running?" she asked.
"All departments are preparing for the restricted movements
called for by silent running."Commander Norton reported "It'll
initiate in five minutes."
"And Engineering?"
"Engineering, reports all systems should be back online in
six hours.They are beyond the point of no return and must
finish the repairs before they can bring anything up." Captain
Anthony said seemingly unconcerned.
"And what is the current plan?" Tarva said looking at her
Captain.
"We sit and hope they don't see us.The planet is big
enough, unless they actually see us they shouldn't pick up any
sign of us."
"Hence the silent running."
"That's correct, Commander."
"I hope it works."
"Your not the only one." Captain Anthony reclined his chair
slightly and looked at the screen.
The crew of the Vigilante began a long wait.They took
their places in the Rough Duty chairs.All accept essential
activity was curtailed.
Many automatic systems were discontinued or limited.The
Turbo lifts ran at one quarter speed unless an emergency over
ride was issued.Most important, however, was that the life
support circulation systems were also limited.
When the Vigilante's orbit took it to the night side of the
planet the temperature dropped to an unusual and generally
uncomfortable 5 degrees Celsius.On the day side the
temperature rose some what but the hull construction didn't
allow much solar energy to penetrate.Temperature changes were
expected so all Rough Duty seats were temperature controllable
but it didn't help much.
Engineering continued their repairs but at a much slower
pace.Noises from any accidents may be picked up by the Romulan
ship, especially if it was a research vessel with hypersensitive
scanners.
The arms holding the warp drives did not have artificial
gravity.The engineers working on the drives were carried
through the arms in specially designed turbo lifts.They then
worked in zero gravity using magnetic tools and holders. The
work required highly skilled personnel and was extremely
dangerous.
The valve that ruptured, had been damaged during the
original mishap.When it blew, the specialist never new what
hit her.A large blast of gas crushed her against the bulkhead,
it also caused an exterior evacuation valve to blow.The
resulting gas leak caused a bright orange streak as it burned in
the planet's atmosphere.
When the emergency lights flashed, Ensign O'Malley shifted
the view screen to reverse.As the bridge crew watched, an
orange streak flared out behind them.
Captain Anthony turned to his First Officer and said "I
think we're in trouble".
"Engineering, what happened down there?" Tarva said.
"Unknown, Sir" came Chief Swanson's voice "Commander
Dolittel is suiting up to take a team and have a look."
Tarva turned on the view screen and looked at the concern on
Swanson's face. "We're going to need maneuvering as soon as
possible."Tarva said trying to stress the urgency.
"Commander," Swanson said "We still needed two hours before
the accident happened."
"Chief, we need to get this thing moving.We're also going
to need weapons or your not going to have time to finish the
repairs."Captain Anthony said.
Chief Swanson had gone ghost white, dealing with command was
not her job, she was a transporter Chief."We'll do what we
can." she said and turned off the screen.
Anthony turned to Tarva and said "Chief Swanson needs some
help."
Tarva headed toward the turbo lift issuing the emergency
over ride commands as she went.
"Sir" it was Ensign O'Malley.
"Yes, Ensign."
"Sir, all the drop ships are armed and D.S. Three is still
equipped with cargo latches..."
"Of course, we can use it to change our orbit, if we have
time.Commander Norton take Ensign O'Malley, launch two drop
ships, one to provide cover the other to move the Vigilante."
the Captain said.
"Ensign O'Malley?" Commander Norton asked the Captain.
"She's the only one on board who's had experience piloting
the tug converted Drop Ship."
"Very well." Norton said joining the navigator at turbo-lift
two and said to the intercom "Shuttle bay, prepare drop ships
three and seven for emergency use."
"Acknowledged" was the brief reply.
As the pair left the bridge Captain Anthony reconfigured his
console for the navigator station.
As soon as the turbo lift's door closed Commander Norton
started giving additional instructions to the shuttle bay.
"Commander, Sir, don't we have any other Drop Ship pilots on
board?" Ensign O'Malley asked when Commander Norton finished
talking to the shuttle bay.
"No, we do not.The drop ship pilots will be boarded after
the space trials"
"That helps us a lot now doesn't it?"
"Well, Ensign, it's keeping you busy."
The turbo-lift's high speed yellow warning light flashed,
then it jerked to a stop at the shuttle bay.In the shuttle
bay, two Drop Ships waited for launch.Out side of the lift two
light weight pilot's pressure suits waited for them.
They had already started removing their baggy black uniforms
while in the lift.Jackets and boots laying on the floor of the
lift, Commander Norton and Ensign O'Malley stepped out of their
pants as they stepped out of the lift and into the pressure
suits.
The doors of the Drop Ships stood open and the engines were
already warming up.As they approached the ships, the shuttle
bay doors opened with only a force field between them and open
space.When they entered their perspective ships, the lowered
steps practically lifted them in as they closed behind them.
As soon as she was strapped in, Ensign O'Malley had Drop
Ship Three powered up for launch.She watched D.S. Seven launch
and flicker out practically before he was out of the bay. Janice
waited a preset time and launched D.S. Three.As soon as she
could power back from launch she too engaged the cloaking.
Time was of the essence, the gas they leaked had burned in
their orbit.It's composition, caused a solid sensor reading
when it burned.Her goal was to shift the Vigilante to a
different orbit so the Romulans would be a lot less likely to
find it.Luckily they had taken an orbit on the opposite side
of the planet but it wouldn't be long before they spotted the
gas trail.
Immediately after launching, Ensign O'Malley turned D. S.
Three back toward the bulbous main body of the Vigilante.She
skimmed across the hull between the upswept arms of the top warp
engines.The magnetic couplings were extended searching for the
Vigilante's frame.
Since the Romulan's sensors would have a very difficult time
finding the Vigilante the largest worry was someone actually
seeing them from a view screen or window.If They got close
enough to be spotted, D.S. Seven would have to destroy the
Romulan ship before it could report to it's superiors.Under no
circumstances, could the Vigilante allow it's existence be known
by the Romulans.
The Vigilante was designed with scramblers, hopefully
capable of confusing the Borg for an extended period of time.
They were prepared to use the scramblers to prevent the Romulans
from reporting back until D.S. Seven was able to destroy them.
Hopefully, it would not come to that.
The feedback from the couplings told her she was over a
likely spot.Slowly she landed D.S. Three on the hull of the
Vigilante and engaged the couplings at full strength.The
connection, however, was not strong because of the composite
hull but it would have to do.
The Drop Ship's sensors showed the Romulan closing the gap
from the opposite side of the planet.She had to move the
Vigilante away from the current orbit and try to keep the planet
between them and the Romulans.
The problem was that because of the weak connection she
could not accelerate quickly.She had to work slowly and nudge
the Vigilante into a still lower and different orbit.
"Ensign O'Malley," came Captain Anthony's voice over the
directed beam communications "their getting close."
"Sir, I have a weak connection if I accelerate too quickly
I'll lose it.How much longer till we have cloaking back on
line?"
"Because of the accident, Commander Dolittel estimates we're
back to just under two days."

-----------

The Romulan research vessel, Raptor, had just returned to
its post.It's mission was the study of the effects of a
collapsing red star on it's planets.
"Commander, I read some kind of an anomaly on the opposite
side of the planet." the young female Romulan said almost
apologetically.
"Elaborate." said an older female Romulan sitting in the
middle of the bridge.
"I was running standard high altitude atmospheric scans when
I watched an object form and grow in low orbit.It reads as a
solid cylinder about 10 symtons long.We are currently too far
away to get an accurate reading on it's composition." said the
young sensor operator.
"Perhaps we have found a new phenomenon."said the lead
scientist sitting at another sensor station.
"Helm, adjust orbit for close inspection of this anomaly"
the Commander said.
The Raptor adjusted orbit to intercept the anomaly.As they
approached, the sensor operator reported "Sir, it is not solid,
it appears to be a gas that registered solid on the long range
sensors."
As the lead scientist studied his scanners he reported "I am
not aware of any element that would create that kind of
reading."
The anomaly was soon close enough to be put on the screen.
It was a long orange streak that seemed to be fading into the
atmosphere.
The young sensor operator finished the analysis and said
"Sir, it appears to be pure mhalogin gas burning in the
atmosphere."
"Where did it come from." the Commander said to herself.
"Did you say mhalogin?" came an older male's voice from an
open door.
"Yes, Centurian, but mhalogin does not appear naturally in
pure form and is rare in the Empire" the operator said.
"I know, but the Federation uses it to cool warp drives."
the Centurian said.
With the Centurian's comment the Commander hit the Red Alert
and yelled "Shields....Shields..."Before the inexperienced
crew was able to bring shields up the ship rocked from an
explosion.
"What happened?" the Commander shouted.
"We've been hit" replied the Centurian calmly.
"Get those shields raised.Damage report, where were we
hit..sensors, who fired on us" the Commander shouted feeling
that she was about to lose her first command.
The Centurian stood at a console after relieving a much
younger crew member."Commander," he said "the shields are
inoperative."
The bridge rocked from another explosion from a different
side of the ship.The helm console exploded in the operator's
face.
"What's happening? Helm, get us out of here.Communications
issue a distress call, tell them we are being attacked by an
unknown force."
"Commander," the Helmsman said after the sparks died down
from her console. "I get no response from my console and
engineering reports major damage from the last blast.All
engines are off line."
"Commander," the senors Operator said "the sensors are
inoperative, all I get is static."
The Communications Officer said "All communications are
down, I was not able to issue the distress call."
The Centurian studied the communications console then the
scanners."Commander," he said.
"Centurian" she acknowledge.
"I believe our scanners and sensors are being jammed.They
were not damaged in either attack.Also," he said "the two hits
we received were precise, they knew right were to cripple us
with minimal damage."
The Commander sat down in her chair heavily and looked at
the fading orange streak."A trap and we fell right into it.
How did the Federation get into the heart of the Empire without
detection."
"Maybe they didn't." the Centurian said.
"What do you mean."
"Perhaps this is a test.Perhaps you are being tested for
worthiness for higher command."
She looked at him suspiciously "If this were the case
wouldn't you be told of it?"
"I have no such knowledge."
"Is this how they tested you in your day?"
"We did not have the precision when I was young to conduct
this kind of test.I have also never heard of it being done.
This does not, however, preclude it from starting."
"So you don't have any actual knowledge that this is some
kind of test?"
"Just the facts so far.We are in the middle of the Empire
in an inconsequential system.We have been attacked by an
unseen enemy with such precision that we are totally helpless
but have suffered very light casualties.In fact so far there
have been no deaths reported.It is my duty to report all
possible alternatives to you."
The Communications officer had been checking the
surveillance films. "Commander," he said "I have found the
scenes of the attack."
"We have pictures of our attacker?"
"They're real brief, I missed them the first time around.I
slowed the tape down and you can see it frame by frame."
"Main screen"
"This is the first attack." the Communications officer said
as he pressed a few buttons.
The view was an angle up from under main body of the ship.
A frame at a time passed and they watched the nose of a strange
looking ship start to uncloak.The star field peeled away from
it as if the ship were emerging from a pool of water.Before it
was half uncloaked a missile fired from its nose.The cloaking
began to reform around the front of the ship as the tail
finished uncloaking.At no time, was there a frame that showed
the ship totally uncloaked.
The Communications officer then said "I can overlay all
frames and get a complete picture of the craft."He pushed a
few more buttons and a complete picture of the mysterious ship
appeared on the screen.In front of it was a stream of
torpedoes caused be the overlaying of the frames.
The ship was a dull gray color.It had a stub nose with
bridge obviously the top half and weapons appeared to fill the
bottom half.The body was wide and boxy with a single access
door on the side.The back lifted above the box with what was
obviously the drives.Missing, were the standard warp drive
pods sticking away from the body.
"No warp drives." The Commander said.
"Were did it come from, if it doesn't have warp drives?"
someone asked.
"A mother ship." The Centurian answered.
"Do you know what it is?" the Commander asked the Centurian.
"My best guess, would be what we used to call a 'personnel
lander'" the Centurian said."We used them when I was a very
young officer and the Empire was expanding rapidly.They
quickly carried warriors into battle zones where transporters
could not be used.Planets that had transporter scramblers or
whose atmosphere scrambled transporters naturally.I even
commanded several landing crews."The Centurian shuttered at
the memory of the bloody battles.These operations were not
well chronicled because of their high mortality rate.
"Is this one of those landers?" the Communications officer
asked.
The Centurian walked up to the screen and said "No, but it
has similar features." he indicated the wide body and rounded
bottom. "The bottom appears to have extra protection for the
stress of dropping through the atmosphere."He then pointed to
the back."The main drives sit high, allowing for cargo to be
quickly loaded on and off through wide back doors.If we had a
view of the back I'd stake my life it's got them back there.
Finally, if it wasn't designed to go into battle, it wouldn't be
armed and cloaked.If it were designed for battle in space, it
would have warp drives, therefore, it must be designed for
battle planet side."
The Commander sat and studied the picture then said "What do
sensors say during the exact time these frames were taken?"
The scanner Operator said "I've been running all scanner
logs for the time frame.The best I can come up with is that
they seem to have picked the ship up as a small piece of debris
of undetermined make up."She then replaced the image on the
screen with the scanner interpretation for the same area and
time.
Half the screen showed a graphic representation of what the
scanners had picked up the other side showed an analysis of the
same data.The graphics showed an irregular shaped lump fade
on, stay several frames, then fade out.At the time the lump
reminded on screen the analysis showed size about a quarter that
of the ship they had seen and mass as undetermined.No life was
registered and all other data showed as undetermined.
"What ever this thing is," the Commander said "It barely
needs cloaking"
"Why doesn't it just destroy us and get it over with?" the
Helmsman asked.
"Centurian," the Commander said "What would happen if we
suffered a massive loss of coolant from a warp drive?"
"We'd be crippled" he replied.
"That's right.If this landing craft doesn't have warp
drives, it couldn't have leaked the mhalogin.Therefore,
another ship must have leaked it."
"It's protecting it's mother ship while effecting repairs".
"And if the landing craft is cloaked and immune to the
sensors so probably would be the mother ship.If it were still
cloaked, however, they wouldn't be worried about us being here."
"The Federation doesn't cloak its ships," The Centurian
added "but The Klingons do."
The Commander turned and looked at the Centurian and asked
"After all these years in service to the Empire, do you truly
believe the Klingons would have let us live?"
"No"
"Now forgetting the official propaganda about the Federation
and relying only on your experience as a War Bird commander,
what would the Federation do?"
"The Federation would do all they could to avoid killing
even a sworn enemy." he said as if having a terrible secret
dragged from him.
The Commander continued to look at her Second in Command and
advisor then said "What if the Federation is experimenting with
new technology, were would be the best place to put it to a true
test?Inside the Romulan Empire, right.Now, what if they had
an accident while stalking a harmless scientific vessel?"
"They would do all they could to keep us from finding them
out."
"Precisely,If their cloaking is down our scanners would
pick them up but only as debris of undetermined make up, like
the landing craft."
"So, they would have to cripple us while they limped away to
make repairs."
The Commander suddenly smiled and said to the crew "Run all
scanner logs since picking up the mhaligon trail.Look for any
debris of undetermined makeup.Also, run a high resolution scan
of all view screen logs looking for anything that looks like
another ship."
A loud claxon began blaring all over the ship.The bridge
crew looked at the Commander and the Centurian.
The Commander said almost in a panic "It's the Intruder
alert from engineering."
Practically before the Commander had a chance to finish,
several places on the bridge shimmered briefly and figures
wearing dull gray armored suits with darkened face shields where
standing in strategic locations.Before anyone on the bridge
had time to react, the intruders started shooting large black
phasers at them.
The Commander and Communications officer were the first to
go down.Before the Centurian was hit, he had time to fire his
disrupter at one of the intruders.Several inches ahead of the
suit, a deflector shield shimmered when the blast hit.The
armored intruder returned fire and the Centurian was thrown
against the console he had taken over earlier.
Meanwhile, all over the ship, including the bridge,
canisters appeared and began emitting a white gas.The effects
were relatively slow but the crew was soon unconscious.Those
that were able to grab a gas mask were soon stunned down by an
armored figure that would beam in, shoot them, remove the mask,
then beam out.
Two minutes after the intruder alert claxon came on a gloved
had reached to the Commander's console and turned it off.
Commander Tarva looked at the command console through her
helmet."Let's work fast" she said into her intercom "the
sooner we get back, the sooner Commander Dolittel will be able
to get back to work on the warp drives."With transporters on
line, Dolittel was unable to continue repairs.
Another figured appeared on the bridge with phaser in hand.
Commander Norton looked around and said to Tarva "All ships
personnel have been neutralized.Once the gas is gone they
should be out about seventy two hours."
"That should give Mr Dolittel more than enough time." Tarva
said as she pulled the Commander from her seat and dropped her
on the floor."OK, all personnel listen up, our first mission
is to find out if they actually saw the Vigilante.If they did
we'll have to destroy the ship.I regret it, but its necessary
for our own survival.If we can find no record that they have
seen the Vigilante we must remove all records of their encounter
with us, starting with their entrance into this star system."
"Too bad we don't have the time to wipe their memories as
well, that would make it really clean." Norton said.
Tarva said "I know, but all they will have is memories of a
mysterious attack and no proof that will, in any way, link it to
the Federation.Just speculation.Without concrete evidence
the decision makers will not lend a lot of credence to their
reports."
"I hope your right." Norton said.
Tarva smiled and said "So do I." she had taken the
Commander's seat and began down loading the ship's technical
data banks to the Vigilante.She also began down loading all
ship's logs to the Vigilante.She knew that in the time they
had, she wouldn't get all of the information from either data
bank but would get quite a bit.
After five hours, Commander Tarva signaled to the Vigilante
'mission complete'.All the Vigilante personnel and gas
canisters beamed off at once.With the canisters gone the
ship's life support would start clearing the gas off the ship.
Once the gas was gone, the crew would remain unconscious for an
estimated seventy two hours.

-----------

Sixty eight hours after beaming off the Romulan ship,
Commander Dolittel signaled the bridge that all systems were on
line and functioning properly.They had also begun to pickup
transmissions to the Romulan ship.The transmissions meant that
they would soon be having more company, investigating the lost
contact.
The Vigilante jumped to warp 9.6 as soon as leaving the star
system.Captain Anthony immediately ordered a course plotted
back to sector 5876.34 using the controlled worm hole effect.
The crew nervously watched the count down remembering the last
trip.
This time Dolittel's realignments worked, dropping the
Vigilante into the correct sector.The worm hole effects were
not nearly as sever and the exit was nearly undetectable when
they dropped out.
The Captain then gave the original coordinates as new
heading.The Vigilante immediately jumped to warp eight for its
new destination.

-----------

The Enterprise had been waiting at the predetermined meeting
place with no contact.They were several days over the
estimated window of arrival.Captain Picard, however, had
strict orders to stay on station until ordered other wise.
"Captain" Lieutenant Worf said "Sub-space message coming in,
for your eyes only".
"Thank you, Mr Worf, I'll take it in my ready room."
The message was cryptic, to say the least, but it told
Picard all he needed to know.After reading the message Captain
Picard remained in his ready room and called Mr Worf in.
"Captain, there has been some trouble in Ten Forward." Worf
said stiffly before Picard could get down to his own business.
"What kind of trouble?"
"Sir, Two of our guests have been fighting rather severely."
"Just how severely?"
"They fought using knives, Sir.Doctor Crusher is currently
mending both of them.It seems they were able to inflict quite
a bit a damage to each other before security intervened." Worf
said obviously embarrassed for the performance of his personnel.
"Is there something you think I should do about this, Mr
Worf?" asked Picard.
"Sir, I was wondering what kind of punishment I should
impose since they are guests."
"Well, don't they have a Senior Officer who can deal with
this kind of situation."
At this Worf stiffened a little more "Sir, the combatants
were a Klingon officer and a Kalonian officer both claiming the
position.They decided to settle the argument; traditionally."
Picard sat back in his chair steepling his fingers in front
of his face and said "I see, perhaps after Doctor Crusher is
finished with them they should be placed together in the brig
for the duration of their stay on the Enterprise.If either is
still alive when it is time to leave we'll let their new
assignment take care of any further punishment.
"The reason I called you in, Mr Worf, is because I'd like
you to inform our guests that they should report to their
assigned assembly areas with their gear in eighteen hours."
"Will that be all, Sir." Worf Said before leaving.
"Yes, dismissed."
Worf turned crisply and walked back onto the bridge.

-----------

The two sat in the detention cell staring at each other.
They each wore a strange baggy black uniform with several
pockets.One had the high, ridged forehead and nose of the
Klingon the other had a similar forehead but not nearly as
pronounced.The Kalonian stood a few centimeters shorter than
the Klingon but matched him in weight and stubbornness.
"If they hadn't interfered," the Klingon snarled "you'd be
dead, I had you beaten."he spoke in Federation Standard since
Kalonians and Klingons traditionally despised learning or
speaking the others' language.
The Kalonian laughed and said "You fool, you were about to
let your guard down thinking I was beaten.Then I would have
ended your life.Accept me as your superior officer and I'll
let you live when we get to where we are going."
Now it was time for the Klingon to laugh "I find it
distasteful enough to serve next to a Kalonian, I would sooner
die than serve under one."
"Like I said, that could be arranged."
At that the Klingon growled and advanced toward the Kalonian
who did the same.Before they came to blows they heard someone
holler to them.It was the Enterprise's resident Klingon.
"It is time to go." he said shutting off the force field.
He than threw them their bags, already packed."Come with me,
you can take this up at you new assignment."Worf turned and
walked out of the detention area.
"You have trained together for many months," Worf said to
the pair as they followed him down the corridor. "I would think
that these differences would have been worked out by now."
"We trained in different teams." the Kalonian said.
The Klingon, like most, tried his best to ignore this
Federation fool.
Worf lead them to a cargo bay which was filled with many
more all wearing the same black uniform.The group was
comprised of a number of different peoples.Most prevalent were
Humans, Klingons, and Kalonians both male and female.There
were others too some looked like Volcans and other assorted
Federation races.
"What are we suppose to do here?" the Klingon said as he
entered the cargo bay.
"Wait." Worf said and closed the door behind them and
continued down the corridor to a turbo-lift.

Picard checked his the chronometer and said "Discontinue all
scanner operations, lower shields and turn off all exterior
recording devices."
Commander Ryker looked puzzled and said "Sir, do you think
that is a wise thing to do, this close to the Neutral Zone?"
"Number One, if it wasn't the proper thing to do, I wouldn't
do it.Now are all of our guests in their assigned areas?"
"Yes, Sir," Ryker said "and all ship's personnel have left
the areas."
"Very good"
"Now What?"
"Now we wait." Picard said as he sat down in his chair.
"Sir," Commander Data Looked up from his console "All
personnel in the cargo and shuttle bays have just disappeared, I
believe they have been transported."
Picard smiled and said "Thank you Mr Data, now return to
normal operating conditions and set new course...."

"The Warriors"

...
Thank God! there is always a Land of Beyond
For us who are true to the trail;
A vision to seek, beckoning peak,
A fairness that never will fail;
A pride in our soul that mocks at a goal,
A manhood that irks at a bond,
And try how we will, unattainable still,
Behold it, our Land of Beyond!

"THE LAND OF BEYOND"





All of the new personnel had been transported directly to a
shuttle bay.The main deck of the huge bay wasfilled with the
black uniformed new arrivals.Few of them noticed the strangers
standing in the front of the room.It was hard, since the
strangers also wore the baggy black uniform.
They had just enough time to adjust from the unannounced
transportation when the ship's public address system came on.
"Your attention please." a man with long graying hair said.
The four hundred or so new personnel looked at him but basically
ignored his request and continued to talk among themselves.
This time he spoke in a louder authoritarian voice "Crew,
Attention!".
Their past months of training went into effect and the bay
was instantly silent and all personnel stood at attention.All
eyes turned attention to the three standing at the head of the
bay.
The two males stood about two meters tall, one was a human
with long graying shoulder length hair pulled back in a pony
tail.The other was slightly shorter than the human he appeared
to be a vulcan and was totally bald.
The third was a short female with long hair braided and
hanging down the middle of her back.From her high smooth
forehead and brown skin many immediately guessed her to be a
Kalonian.
The human continued to address them "I am Captain Anthony"
he said "and it is my honor to welcome you aboard the United
Star Ship Vigilante.The mission of the Vigilante is considered
extremely hazardous the exact details will be released to you in
due time.Right now, I'd like to introduce you to my senior
officers."
He indicated the female and said "this is my first officer,
Commander Tarva and this is Chief of Security, Commander Norton.
With the stations you will be assigned to, many of you will
report directly to Commander Tarva or Commander Norton."
Captain Anthony then indicated a large view screen on one
wall of the bay."If you'd examine the screen, you'll see your
current station and room assignments.You have half an hour to
get settled in your quarters and report to your duty assignments
for introductory meetings.Any questions?"
There was something said in Klingon in the middle of the
room and several Klingons laughed amongst themselves.
"Federation Standard will be spoken on the Vigilante."
Captain Anthony said "If you have something to say, say it now!"
A Klingon stepped forward and addressed the Captain "As a
member of the Klingon Empire, and for its greater honor, I have
resigned my self to working with Kalonians," he said spitting
the last word then said "but I will not answer to one especially
a female."
Commander Tarva stepped toward the Klingon and looked up at
him.He was a large muscular warrior who was obviously well
seasoned and highly respected.The shuttle bay was quieter now
then when the Captain was speaking.
She flipped open her communicator and said "Will a medical
team please report to Shuttle Bay One."She then looked at the
Klingon and smiled slightly.The Klingon looked down at her
defiantly.
What happened next the Klingon never saw coming.Commander
Tarva started to turn to her left then kicked out sideways at
him with her right foot.The bones in his lower left leg
snapped like dry sticks, he immediately screamed and fell toward
the deck.As he fell, Tarva struck down at him with her left
hand.His face caved in from the blow as his jaw shattered.
His head flung to the opposite shoulder and pinkish red blood
splattered across the floor and up on some of the crew standing
behind him.He spun totally around, landing on his back.
Tarva turned and looked at what was suppose to be a crew of
highly trained professional warriors.She continued to wear her
smile and said "Is there anyone else who wishes to register a
complaint?" she sounded more like a waitress asking a customer
for an order.
The crew remained totally silent, finally one of the
Kalonions began to chant.It was an ancient war chant used
before going into battle, the other Kalonians soon joined him.
The rest of the crew stood in total silence.

-----------

The Klingon limped to his quarters.He had missed his group
meeting, even the current medical techniques took time to work.
When he entered the cabin the Kalonian he had spent the time in
detention with was there.
"What are you doing here?" he said through wires in his
mouth.
"We are to share this cabin." the Kalonian said.
"Why am I not surprised."The Klingon walked over to the
bunk with his bag on it.
"Perhaps it is time for introductions" the Kalonian said "I
am called Golta."
"I am Kartang." replied the Klingon through his wires.
The quarters would have been large for a single on the
Vigilante.There was one main room with the bunks on either
side and the door on the opposite wall.The door to the head
was to the right of the main door past one of the bunks.Built
into the wall that was most toward the back of the ship were two
high back chairs with swing across restraints and buckle down
harnesses.
Kartang inspected the bunk and declared it a typical
Federation luxury.As with Golta, his possessions on this trip
were few but he neatly put them in the few drawers allocated to
him.
"Kartang, may I ask you a question?"
Kartang looked at him and growled "Why are you being civil
toward me, Kalonian?"
"I have considered the consequences of trouble on this ship.
I've decided that it would be in both of our interests to get
along."
Kartang scratched at the wires in his mouth and said "What
is your question?"
"Had you ever heard of Commander Tarva before today?" Golta
asked sounding as sincerely as his deep Kalonian voice allowed.
"No, I had not." Kartang spat.
"There are not many Kalonians in Star Fleet." Golta said "So
we tend to know about those who are.Like you would knowabout
the Klingon on the Enterprise."
"Yes we know about him." Kartang hissed.
"Commander Tarva comes from one of the Southern provinces on
Kalon.Her family was one of the few that stayed with the
absolute traditional Kalonian way.These Traditionalists
trained their children to be soldiers from the time they were
born."
"So we found out." Kartang mumbled.
Golta pretended he didn't hear the comment.Just continued
with the story "When they come to the age of decision, they
would chose a discipline.Many would chose to be line soldiers
others qualified for training as officers.There are many needs
in a well equipped defense force.The traditionalists always
garnered the top ranks due to their extensive training.Tarva
rose quickly through the ranks and it was thought one day she
would be highly placed."
"So what's your point?" Kartang groweled.
"I'm getting to it." Golta responed then continued..
"Tarva was accepted into the Elite Strike Forces.Only
fifty percent of the candidates who enter training survive.
Remember, only the best of the best are accepted in to the
program.Tarva finished at the top of her class and ranked in
the top five percent of all who have ever finished.
"Not long after she finished training in the E S F her
parents were killed on duty.As a result, she became
disenchanted with the role she had in the Defense Force.Though
it is a great honor for mates to die together in the line of
duty, she could not accept it.She resigned her commission and
applied to Star Fleet Academy.There is an old saying on Kalon,
loosely translated it means 'Once E.T.F., Always E.T.F.'"
Kartang sat on his bunk rubbing his leg and looking at his
room mate.Golta could see the anger in his eyes.
"If I hadn't experienced Commander Tarva first hand, I would
laugh at your Elite Strike Forces." he said trying to keep
saliva from dripping from the wires.
"I too, always thought they were just a lot of talk." Golta
admitted with a bit of a smile.
The two looked at each other for a second and then burst
into their races' hardy laughs.
The intercom piped on "Lieutenant Kartang, report to the
Command Room".
"Acknowledged." he said.
Kartang looked at Golta and said "How do I find this Command
Room?" as he stood from his bunk.
"The Command Room is off the bridge."
Kartang stood for a moment then limped out of the room.
The bridge crew acknowledged his presence as if he had been
a long time companion.The bridge was basically laid out like
most standard Federation bridges.The main difference was that
all stations were designed for access from the same kind of
chairs as were built into the wall in his cabin.They even
included the restraints and belts.This seemed to be a standard
on the Vigilante.
Sitting at the far end of the slightly curved table that
basically filled the command room were Captain Anthony,
Commander Tarva and Commander Norton.The chairs around the
table were similar to the others he'd observed on the Vigilante
including all belts and restraints.
Commander Tarva stood to great him."Lieutenant Kartang,
this meeting has been called to fill you in on what you missed
during your visit to Sick Bay.First I'd like to say that all
assignments were made before your arrival.They were based on
your performance during training and your experience prior to
volunteering for the mission.Won't you have a seat."She
motioned to one of the seats near where they were sitting.
She watched him examine the built in restraints. "They are
called Rough Duty seats, their purpose will be explained to you
in due time."
He sat down in the chair then leaned back casually.He was
trying his best to look slightly defiant.
"As I was saying, assignments are based on performance
during training and prior experience.We do not have time to
evaluate our crew before making assignments.It has been
decided that your assignment will be Drop Ship Commander.With
this, will come a promotion to Lieutenant Commander.The
position also places you in the official emergency chain of
command.You are now fifth in command of the Vigilante."
With this announcement the Captain and Commander Norton
stood and offered their hands in congratulations.They then
announced that they had business elsewhere and dismissed
themselves.
Commander Tarva motioned for Kartang to sit back down."We
have some more business to attend to." She said.
Kartang sat down and wiped away some saliva caused by the
wires in his mouth.Kartang struggled to contain his animosity
toward Tarva.Earlier it was easy with the other two in the
room, it was difficult with her sitting less then a meter across
the table from him.He had not yet said a word, he was very
conscious of his mouth full of hardware.
"Now for the chain of command, if your going to be in it you
had better know it.You will report directly to Commander
Norton who is actually third in command to myself.The officer
who is fourth in command is Commander Dolittel, Chief of
Engineering.This chain is implemented in emergency only, it is
not necessarily the day to day order of command.If we are ever
in a situation where the top command staff is unable to perform
their duties we need to be sure a warrior will be in charge of
the Vigilante.
"Do you have any questions so far?"
"Yes." he snarled and leaned toward her across the table.
"Why did you do this to your fifth in command." he spat and
opened his mouth to show her the wires.
Tarva maintained her same composure and said "I did not know
who you were when you came forward. If I did," she paused and
leaned across the table to meet him face to face ~'I would have
done the exact same thing.'~ She said the last in perfect
Klingon.
Kartang looked at her disbelieving and sat back in his
chair.
Tarva did too and continued in standard "The Vigilante is
going on what many know could be a suicide mission.To simply
mark your record for insubordination would mean something only
if we return.So any infractions in proper behavior must be
dealt with on the spot and severely.
"Is there anything else, Lieutenant Commander Kartang."
"Not at this time." Kartang said calmly.
"Very good, report to Commander Norton he should be in
shuttle bay three.He'll give you a tour of your area and
outline your responsibilities.Dismissed."
Kartang stood, came to stiff attention then limped toward
the door.
"Oh, I've been, ah, 'informed' by medical that the small
bone knitters may be functional tomorrow."Tarva was barely
able to suppress a grin of satisfaction.
Kartang stiffened trying to ignore what she was implying.
"One last thing." Tarva said as the door opened for him.
"Yes, Sir." he growled.
"There will be a notation made in your permanent record for
insubordination, for the incident earlier today."
"Yes, Sir." he repeated and walked onto the bridge.

-----------

The shuttle bays and connected training areas took up more
than two thirds of the bulbous main body of the ship.
Engineering occupied most of the rest.The crew quarters and
most weapons stations were in the saucer section, there was no
neck connecting the saucer to the main body.
Kartang stood in the massive Shuttle Bay Three.The bay was
not filled with shuttles, it was filled with strange looking
long boxy ships.These must be the drop ships they had been
talking about.Most were placed in racks and several were on
the deck as if prepared for launch.Others were on lifts being
worked on.
Commander Norton was in a control booth that over looked the
main launch deck.Kartang limped to the one man, open air lift
and road it to the booth, maintaining a perfect Klingon at-ease
posture.
When commander Norton saw Kartang arrive he smiled and said
"Ah, Lieutenant Commander, welcome to the Cavern."
"The Cavern, Sir?" Kartang said.
"Shuttle Bay 3 is the largest shuttle bay on the Vigilante
and in fact one of the largest in Star Fleet.So its been
nicknamed the Cavern."
"Sir, Commander Tarva told me to report to you for an
introduction to my duties." Kartang remained the serious, out of
his element, Klingon.
Norton pointed out the window at the Drop Ships in the bay.
"The U.S.S. Vigilante carries 30 DS-300 series 5 Drop Ships and
five standard transports.The DS-300 was originally designed to
land anti-terrorist units in troubled regions of the Federation.
The DS-300 Series 5 was designed and built specifically for this
mission.It is built of the same composite material as the
Vigilante."
"Sir, what composite material?"
"Oh yes you missed the introductory meetings." Commander
Norton then briefed Kartang on the properties of the composite
material.
"So the ships become invisible to sensors without cloaking?"
"The sensor profile is reduced greatly.For instance at
close range the Vigilante reads about the size of a tug and
appears to be unmanned.The Drop Ships appear as debris and a
pressure suit made of the material is virtually invisible."
"Wouldn't it be easier and more effective to cloak the
ship?"
"The Vigilante and the Drop Ships are cloaked.Cloaking,
however, can fail.The composite also reflects energy and
reduces the damage a direct hit may cause.It might be enough
to save the ship from only a hit or two but that can still make
a difference in survival."
"What precisely are my duties as Drop Ship Commander?"
"You are in charge of the Drop Ships, from maintenance to
planning and coordinating missions."
"I have never seen a drop ship before, now I am in command
of a fleet of them.Why didn't they train us on these things?"
"In order to preserve secrecy you couldn't use Drop Ships,
but the trainers you did use are very similar.They do have
their own idiosyncrasies though, that is why I've arranged for
you take a ship out for a test flight.Since I am too busy to
be your co-pilot, I have assigned the only other experienced D S
pilot on the Vigilante to ride with you."
"I do not need lessons on how to pilot any ship."
"I don't expect you would but I want somebody there whose
flown these things before.This will be the only time you won't
have a say in the matter.Besides she'll probably just sleep or
sight see the whole time anyway."
Kartang moaned he was going on his first D S flight with a
female as chaperone.As long as it wasn't Commander Tarva he
figured he could stand it.
Norton watched Kartang limp to the window and get a better
look at the deck."How much longer do they expect your leg to
hurt, and what's with the wires in your mouth?"
"A day or two." Kartang said through the hardware in his
mouth then said "These shackles are because the small bone
knitters are all temporarily 'out of service', they're suppose
to come out tomorrow."
Commander Norton began showing Kartang the specifics of the
Control Booth and other areas of the operation.Kartang knew he
had a lot to learn and was ready to start.It took all his
concentration to ignore the throbbing in his face and leg.

-----------

The door signaled and Kartang called for the person to
enter.His leg no longer hurt and the wire had been removed
from his mouth.It had been only a day and a half so he was
quite satisfied with the 'progress'.
When Kartang heard someone walk into the room he looked up
from his computer console to see his visitor.
"Lieutenant Commander Kartang," it was a human female with
short red hair.He remembered seeing her on the bridge.
"Yes."
"Sir, I'm Ensign O'Malley, Commander Norton asked me to
accompany you on a Drop Ship test run."
The Vigilante had taken up residence in a seldom traveled
corner of the Federation near the Romulan neutral zone.The
star system had two planets one of which had a turbulent but
breathable atmosphere.The planet was deemed appropriate for
training Drop Ship Crews.The crews, however, were no where
near ready for actual flights.So the Vigilante stayed in the
system running its own tests.
Kartang looked at the young human and moaned to himself.He
knew her history and respected her for where she came from.It
was hard, however, to over come prejudices especially when his
own skills were being compared to this skinny human.
"Yes, I've had DS-1 prepared for testing."Kartang stood
and retrieved his pressure suit gear bag.
The first order Kartang issued required pressure suits worn
during all Drop Ship flights.Previously, they were only
required if hazardous duty was expected.Kartang's theory was
that the Drop Ship's sole purpose was hazardous duty, therefore,
the pressure suit should be worn at all times.

Shuttle Bay Three was different than the other two, it not
only was larger but was designed for rapid deployment of the
Drop Ships.A force field was raised behind the ships to allow
them to exit the bay at high acceleration.Up to four ships
could be launched at a time with rapid replacement.
Shuttle bays one and two were used for recovery and
maintenance.They were also used for movement of cargo so as
not to interfere with bay three.
Ensign O'Malley sat in the co-pilots seat watching Kartang
power up Drop Ship One."Sir, do we want to do a rapid
deployment launch your first time out?"
"I am an experienced pilot," Kartang snapped "if I'm going
to be forced to make this test flight with an observer, I'm
going to push it to the limits."
O'Malley smiled and said "Great."
The pilots' pressure suits were similar to the armored ones
but didn't have all the protection.The material was a form of
the same composite material but woven into a cloth like
substance.The helmets were a lot lighter and the face shields
closed either manually or when emergency alarms were triggered.
"Lieutenant Commander Kartang, to traffic control"
"This is Traffic Control."
"Requesting clearance for launch of DS-1" He said into the
ship's communicator.
"You are cleared for launch" was the immediate reply.
O'Malley and Kartang were pressed into their seats as the
Drop Ship accelerated out of the bay.Before it cleared the
Vigilante's cloaked shields its own were automatically
activated.
Once the acceleration had ceased Ensign O'Malley turned her
chair slightly and looked out a side window."I do so much
piloting, it's nice to have a chance to just ride for once."
After half an hour of standard test maneuvers Kartang said
"Have you ever taken one of these on an actual drop yet?"
Kartang asked as if he was leading up to something.
"No, Sir." O'Malley said turning toward him. "Your not
thinking of doing something unscheduled are you, Sir?"
"They tell me I'm in charge of the Drop Ships, I've decided
it is time to make a test drop."
They had been making simple orbital maneuvers and now headed
toward were the computer placed the Vigilante.
"This is Lieutenant Commander Kartang, to traffic control,
requesting landing clearance."
"You are cleared for landing."was the immediate reply.
"Are the preparations complete for test drop." he asked
flight control as he followed the closed homing beacon into the
cloaked Vigilante.Just before they would have reached the
shields they shimmered and weakened enough to allow the drop
ship in.
"Yes, Sir.DS-eighteen is prepared for test drop."
Kartang turned to O'Malley and said "I've read your record
and it appears you are qualified to ride as co-pilot for the
test drop, if you wish."
"I would need clearance from Commander Tarva."
"I've already obtained her release."
"Sir, I'm honored you recommended me, I hope I do not let
you down."
"Your performance during the crisis with the Romulans
deserves recognition."
"Thank you, Sir."
When they landed, DS-18 was ready for launch.
"Sir, DS-18 has had minimal flight time, do you think it is
wise to use it for the first test drop?"
"Ensign O'Malley," Kartang said harshly "are you questioning
my judgment?"
"No Sir, but as co-pilot it is my job to point out possible
oversights."
"DS-18 has been thoroughly tested, it is time it got some
flight time."
"Yes, Sir."
Sixteen assorted personnel waited inside DS-18 in full
armored pressure suits.The ship was designed to hold sixteen
personnel, eight to a side.The chairs were designed to hold
the large armored suits.During launch, they were turned toward
the front of the ship for acceleration.After acceleration, the
chairs would automatically turn toward the center for easy exit.
"These are some of the Drop Ship pilots," Kartang said as he
and O'Malley entered the ship. "I have decided they should know
what a drop feels like to the crew.I hope this will make them
better pilots."
Kartang looked at the pressure suited warriors.These were
true warriors.He had trained with them, he knew they would
perform well when called upon.The armor he envied to no end.
If he had anything like it when he commanded his ten crew ship
they would have been indestructible.
Kartang sat strapped in the pilot's seat he turned and
looked his copilot.To signal he was ready, he dropped the face
shield on his helmet, she did likewise.
As official copilot, it was O'Malley's duty to call for
clearance.Numbers appeared on the wall above the door over
their runway.A red light bar on the door above their run way
turned yellow when the numbers started counting down.When they
reached 0 the light would turn green and they would launch.
Everything was timed with the Vigilante's orbit designed for
them to land in the designated spot in the minimum amount of
time.
The light turned yellow and the numbers seemed to count down
very slowly.When the numbers reached the end an alarm sounded
in the comm-system, the green light came on and the computer
launched the ship.
DS-18 immediately dropped toward the atmosphere.The
acceleration of the Drop Ship totally countered the orbit of the
Vigilante.It hit the atmosphere with its nosed raised so the
shields on the bottom would take the brunt of the burn in.
The round shape of the shields showed as the heat of entry
was dispersed.Inside, the ship shook violently and the hull
temperature rose.A display in each helmet counted down
projected landing time.
Ensign O'Malley watched the gauges showing exterior
temperature and stresses, all were approaching the red zone.
"Sir, shields are reaching tolerances," she said evenly
"adjusting power.We'll be through burn area in five
seconds..four...three..."
The ship bucked and started to shake violently."Sir,
shields have buckled, it's breaking up.."
Kartang glanced at his copilot then at her gauges.The ship
shuddered again and the hull breach alarm sounded.Kartang had
no more time, he reached up and hit the emergency eject button
above his head.All eighteen occupants immediately beamed out
of the ship and back to the Vigilante.As they beamed away,
Drop Ship 18 exploded and continued to fall to the surface in
flaming pieces.
They materialized on the shuttle bay emergency transporter.
As soon as he could move Kartang pulled off his helmet and threw
it across the bay.Janice thought the whole ship could hear his
blood curdling scream.Five of the other pilots were also
Klingons and two were Kalonians they too were showing similar
displays of frustration.None of them were as violent as
Kartang though.
Kartang came over to O'Malley screaming loudly in Klingon.
His eyes were wide showing all the white and violet streaks of
blood around the edges.
O'Malley pushed her fire red hair off her forehead and
smoothed it.Her early years on Vega-5 had given her a very
thick skin.She looked him in the eyes and waited for him to
stop his tirade, she figured he'd at least have to take a breath
soon.She waited and tried to decide what he had eaten that
gave him such bad breath.
He finally finished and stood looking at her.His eyes were
still wide and his shoulder length hair stood in all directions.
O'Malley reached into her helmet and removed a storage disk from
the gauge area.She put the chip into a nearby console and
pressed a few buttons.
The console immediately lit up showing the entire drop ship
control panel, his controls and hers.Her system and been tied
directly to the ships computer and had acted as a flight
recorder.
"Perhaps, this will help us determine what exactly went
wrong."
Kartang immediately pushed her out of the way and began
studying the output.
In the suit room, the other pilots were already being helped
out of their pressure suits.
"What happened out there, human?" asked Valerta, one of the
Klingon pilots.
"You and that Klingon almost got us killed." one of the
Kalonians said.
"I have no idea," O'Malley said "the shields began to buckle
for no apparent reason.The stresses of landing through even an
atmosphere like that shouldn't have effected it."
"They had better get it fixed before they send us out in
those things again." said a female human pilot.
The pilots began complaining amongst themselves.Even
though O'Malley was also a pilot she wasn't assigned to the drop
ship fleet, therefore, she was an outsider.She could hear them
refer to her several times and look at her.It was obvious they
blamed the outsider for their near demise.Even the humans
didn't seem too sympathetic toward her.
Ensign O'Malley was out of her pilot's pressure suit before
the others were out of their armor.To get away from the pilots
as soon as possible she didn't put on her uniform but decided to
carry it back to her cabin.Wearing the tight black shorts,
tank top and the pressure suit boot liners is how Commander
Tarva found her walking down the hall.
"Ensign O'Malley, what happened out there?!"
"Lieutenant Commander Kartang is currently reviewing the
flight recorder, Sir." Janice said coming to attention.
"Ensign, that is not what I asked you."
O'Malley hesitated for a second looking straight over
Commander Tarva then said "Sir, the shields seemed unable to
handle the atmosphere burn in.I did not notice any incorrect
operating procedures."
"Very well, your complete report will be expected when you
begin your next shift."
"Aye, Sir." O'Malley said and continued toward her cabin now
at double time.

-----------

Captain Anthony, Commander Tarva, and Commander Norton sat
quietly in the briefing room off the bridge.Lieutenant
Commander Kartang was finishing his briefing on the mishap with
Drop Ship 18.He had presented the complete flight recordings
and the analysis of what little wreckage had been retrieved.
"It is my conclusion," he said "that the new design
deflector shields where not properly aligned to withstand the
stress of the drop.Currently all drop ships are being
inspected for similar flaws.At last report, three other ships
have been found to have improperly aligned deflector shields."
Tarva looked at him incredulously "So you are trying to pass
the blame of your mistake to technicians who are not here to
defend themselves and whom you will never meet?"The data he
had presented had clearly supported his analysis, Tarva,
however, still felt the need to test the ebon of the Klingon.
"No, I am not."Kartang growled at Tarva "The misaligned
deflectors were within the tolerances set by Design.I blame
Design for setting improper tolerances."
"Thank you." Commander Nortan said.After Kartang had taken
his seat Norton addressed the room"Taking into account the
other reports and the data from the flight recorders I must come
to the same conclusion." then added "Commander Dolittel has also
came to a similar conclusion."
Kartang sat back and looked at Tarva.She could see the
animosity in his eyes but ignored it.
Captain Anthony finally said "It seems this ship has been
plagued by misalignments.I am ordering that all ship's systems
be retested.We are setting tighter tolerances and expect them
to be maintained."

Golta checked the readouts below the face shield of his
helmet.It had taken some getting used to, looking down inside
his helmet with out moving the helmet.By speaking the
designated codes for the members of team RT-2 he could read all
of their vital signs.He could also get other information
including a display from their suit camera.
Golta was proud he had been assigned a position equal to
that of the Klingon.It would have been intolerable to not only
have to share a room with him but also to be out ranked by him.
As commander of landing forces Golta felt that his position was
much more Glorious.He and his warriors would do the actual
information retrieval, the whole mission was designed so they
could do their job.His, would be the most crucial command.
Right now, he was running a bio-coordination check while
waiting for launch.All other systems checks had been
completed, the bio-check was always the last.To get an
accurate mission standard the bio-coordination was taken just
prior to mission initiation.
The yellow launch light over the bridge door came on
indicating the countdown had commenced.Golta mentally prepared
himself for launch as the green light came on.The force of the
launch pressed him into the large seat.This was his sixth
practice launch and he still cringed behind his darkened face
shield.As soon as the acceleration of the launch ended, the
large chairs turned toward the center of the Drop Ship for rapid
deployment.
This drop wasn't any different than the others, the ship
shook violently as it dropped through the planet's atmosphere.
Golta watched the teams vital signs as they dropped to the
surface.As usual, all including himself showed signs of great
stress.This worried him, if they ever needed to go into battle
this way, what would the stresses be like then.
A yellow light in the middle of the cabin began blinking and
the seat restraints opened indicating landing was near.When it
turned green the back door would drop open and they would file
out in pairs.It didn't matter where they were or what the
conditions were like.The suits would protected them,
hopefully.
Normally, just before the green light came on they could
feel a bump when the ship landed. This time, however, that
didn't happen, the green light came on and the door opened to a
blinding sand storm.The team didn't hesitate though, the
soldiers stood simultaneously and quickly marched out the back
door two at a time.
Golta, for this drop, was to be the last off the craft, one
of the first was his second in command, Lieutenant Whitecloud.
She would be acting command for this mission.
He could hear her sound the warning as she stepped off the
door "Heads up, it's a free fall."

The ship hadn't landed, in fact, it was over a hundred
meters up and flying at a steady velocity when the door opened.
The pressure suited warriors stepped into thin air.The
training again paid off, not one of them panicked.As they
stepped off the door each one stayed perfectly upright and
trusted their equipment.
The suits immediately calculated approximate altitude and
would begin firing built in boosters just in time to land
safely.As they fell, the buffeting weather and the blowing
sand totally blinded and shook them.The suits, however, used
stabilizers to remain up right.Golta tracked the teamon his
suit's scanners as they fell ahead of him.

The weather on the surface wasn't any better.Wind howled
around them restricting vision to the perimeter of the suits
deflector shields.Thestabilizers fired constantly to keep
the suit on it's feet making movement feel extremely jerky.
Whitecloud ordered all to switch to their Electronic Vision
Enhancer (EVE).None of them actually needed to be told to do
this.When EVE was activated the visor went opaque and showed
an electronically enhanced view.The view was a composite of
scanner analysis and non-visible light analysis.The on board
computer then combined and enhanced the output to get a slightly
off color image of what the user should see.
The team slowly separated into a wide formation with
partners always within sight of each other.The rest, stayed
within electronic range.The goal was to survey a large area of
the planet and be at their extraction site at a designated time.
To do this, they would need to be on the move for nearly all of
the next three days.

The sixteen met at the extraction point on schedule and
Whitecloud initiated the extraction beacon.Within five minutes
the extraction warning sounded over the suits' communicators.
The drop ship had entered the atmosphere and would be arriving
momentarily.
"Attention RT-2, extraction beacon pinpointed, E T A 10
minutes."came the voice of the female Klingon known as
Valerta.
"Acknowledged." Whitecloud said.The team put some distance
between themselves and the beacon.
The wind continued to howl around them as they waited for
the drop ship to arrive.The storm was stronger now then it had
been since they were dropped.They couldn't hear the ship but
EVE allowed them to see it dropping toward them.The ship was
being shaken severely by the continuing storm.They could see
it buck through the multiple wind vortexes as it descended ever
closer.
"E T A 2 minutes" Valerta said obviously shaking.
"This is going to be a tough one" Golta commented.
"I'll do it." Valerta said confidently though still shaking.
"Maybe they should have beamed us out." one of the team
said.
"That would defeat the whole point of the exercise." said
Whitecloud.She had lead and coordinated the whole mission, she
wasn't about to let her first chance at leadership be
anti-climaxed by a beam out.
The drop ship landed hard next to the beacon.They could
hear a thump through the storm and filters in the helmets.A
large cloud of yellow dust was thrown up around the ship.EVE
allowed the team to see that the ship appeared to be intact but
they weren't sure.Procedure dictated that they keep their
distance until they were sure the ship was safe.
A minute after landing they saw the back door drop open and
heard Valerta yelling "Lets go, I don't have all day, move,
move, move."
The team immediately began to move as quickly as they could
to the drop ship.Valerta kept the shields raised until the
last possible moment to protect the ship from the wind and sand.
When she dropped the rear shields to allow them access a strong
vortex of wind also got through and lifted the back of the drop
ship.The four already in the ship were dropped toward the
cabin while the three on the door were thrown back off.
The rear of the drop ship lifted several meters and the
whole ship pivoted to port.As it swung, the open door/ramp
caught Ensign Mueller in the neck.Since all suit deflector
shields had been shut down to allow for the close proximity of
boarding the door made direct contact with his helmet.The
force of the impact threw him to ground and slightly separated
the helmet from the suit.
Golta's warning alarm for Ensign Mueller signaled the
breach."Control, we have a suit breach." he said as he went to
the soldier's aid.
Kartang's voice came over the intercom "Get your team out of
there, Kalonian.You know the training regulations about
beaming out a drop team."
The suit stabilizers had also been shut down just prior to
boarding.This caused the troops on the ground to loose
stability in the wind.Golta, as a result had difficulty
reaching Mueller.
When Golta reached him, he could see the Ensign struggling
inside his suit.The planet's atmosphere was not toxic but the
ultra fine dust of the sand storm was blowing directly into his
face.The boy, though highly trained, was beginning to panic as
he couldn't breath, see or get back on his feet.The EVE had
been disabled, and his nose, mouth and eyes were filling with
dust.
The fist thing Golta did was activate what was suppose to be
the suit's automatic sealing.The separated joint immediately
filled with a black gel and the life support systems started
filtering out the dust.Golta then grabbed the ensign by an arm
and pulled him to his feet.
Valerta had finally stabilized the drop ship and the
remaining crew were boarding.Golta and Ensign Mueller just
two meters away, started for the ship.Lieutenant Whitecloud
had gotten the rest of the crew into the ship and met Golta and
Mueller at the bottom of the ramp.
"All other hands secured." she said as she grabbed under
Mueller's other arm and helped Golta get him into the ship.
As soon as they were half-way up the ramp Whitecloud yelled
to her intercom "Close It!".The ramp immediately lifted them
into the ship.
Once the door was closed Golta started trying to get the
helmet off of Mueller.Between the bulk of his own armor and
the drop ship rocking up through the atmosphere it was not an
easy task.It turned out, that the helmet was not damaged, just
separated from the suit.
"This suit wasn't damaged." Golta growled to Whitecloud.
"What happened to it?" she asked as she strapped herself in.
"I don't know." Golta replied as he finally pulled the
helmet from the suit.
Whitecloud checked Mueller's vital signs in her suit
monitors when she heard the vital sign warning."Sir, he's not
breathing." she said and started to unstrap herself.
"Stay in your seat." Golta commanded as he pulled off his
own helmet.
Ensign Mueller was having a sever allergic reaction to the
dust blown into his suit.He was now trying to grasp at his
throat as it swelled shut.Golta tilted Mueller's head back
trying to keep the air way open but the swelling had closed it
off.
"Vigilante" he yelled "Medical Emergency, Ensign Mueller has
suffered a sever allergic reaction his throat has swollen shut."
As he finished talking the ship shook severely and tilted
forward.Golta and Mueller slid across the deck between the
feet of his team and crashed against the forward bulkhead.The
helmets also bounced off the wall next to him and he let out a
primal Kalonian scream.
"Valerta," he yelled "get it steady, We've got problems back
here."
"Sir, I must increase to exit velocity or we won't make it."
she said.
Golta hesitated for a second then ordered "Make it so."
All landing chairs automatically turned forward for
impending acceleration.Valerta then warned "Prepare for
acceleration to exit velocity. 5..4.."
Golta lay over the ensign, straddling him, as he was trying
to activate the suits automatic medication.He had not yet even
had time to remove his gloves so it was difficult finding the
controls inside the collar of the suit.
"3..2.."
The manual overrides inside the collar were designed mostly
for maintenance and testing.Since the suit had been
deactivated for boarding the advanced life support was not
functioning.The boy was beginning to turn blue and had gone
unconscious.
"His pulse is getting weak" Whitecloud said frantically.
"1..0..increasing to exit velocity."
Golta totally lay over the Ensign and wrapped his arms
around his back and held Mueller's head to his chest trying to
protect it.The acceleration threw them back across the ship
against the landing door.
Pinkish red blood gushed from a gash across Golta's temple
but Mueller was unhurt.Golta continued to work against the
acceleration while pressed up to the back door.
Golta sat up, screamed again and began trying to remove one
of his gloves.When it came off he threw it forward against the
cabin door and immediately stuck his hand back down the ensign's
suit.He could barely hear a faint hiss as the suit injected
the boy with the needed drug to help reduce the swelling.
"Pulse seems to have stabilized" Whitecloud informed him
"but he's still not breathing."
The Drop ship shuddered again and leaned hard to port
slamming Golta and the Ensign against the back of one of the
chairs of their comrades.
"His throat's still swollen." Golta said after trying to
breath into him.He then grabbed an emergency kit mounted on
the wall above him.Inside was an assortment of emergency
medical supplies."Normal airways won't work" he said as he
pulled out a long skinny tube. "I'm going to use a nasal
airway".
"Valerta,What's our ETA to transporter range?"Whitecloud
said as she watched Golta slide the tube into Mueller's nose.
"The Vigilante will not transport while we're outside their
shields on any Drop Ship training mission." Valerta replied then
added "ETA to Vigilante 5 minutes."
Once the tube was in place, Ensign Mueller arched his back
as he struggled to catch his breath through it."He should make
it."Golta's deep voice sounded grave.They still lay against
the back door held there by the acceleration.
Whitecloud watched the Kalonian holding Mueller's head back
trying to keep the airway open.He was also closely examining
the suit trying to decide what had gone wrong with it.
The vibration of the Drop Ship's acceleration began to
lesson and the g-forces began to decrease."We are clear of the
atmosphere" Valerta declared "ETA to Vigilante 2 minutes".
"Lieutenant Commander Golta to Vigilante". Golta sounded
relieved.
"Kartang here." was the immediate reply.
"Prepare to fix on my signal and transport directly to Sick
bay".
"Acknowledged."
"Entering Vigilante's shields." Valerta reported.
As soon as the drop ship entered the shield sphere Golta and
Ensign Mueller disappeared.

-----------

Still dressed in full armor and walking back to shuttle bay
three is how Lieutenant Whitecloud found Golta.She had already
showered and changed to her duty uniform when she went looking
for him.
Lieutenant Anndrea Whitecloud had shoulder length black
hair, tide back in a pony tail and held with a small silver and
turquoise clasp.Her skin was still brown from the outdoor
lifestyle she lived on earth before volunteering for this
mission.
"Sir, How is Ensign Mueller?" she said as she turned back to
where she had just come in order to walk with him.
"Ensign Mueller will recover shortly."
Whitecloud noticed that the cut on Golta's temple had been
healed but left as a scar."I see that the Meds on this ship
are familiar with proper Kalonian care."
"Yes, one of the perks of having a Kalonian as First
Officer."
"Sir, have you discovered why Mueller's suit failed?"
"I investigated it before I allowed them to remove him from
it.Apparently, Ensign Mueller was too anxious to get out of
the armor and disengaged one backup system too many."
"Then the fault was his and not the suit?"
"Correct, the suit did not fail, Ensign Mueller did."
The pair turned a final corner and headed into the shuttle
bay.

-----------

Later that day Ensign Whitecloud sat cross legged in the
front room of her quarters.In front of her, on a low stand was
a large, half finished painting, her current project.It was
the picture of a large brown bird with a white head and yellow
beak and talons.It soared over blue-gray mountains far below.
She meticulously painted each feather of the bird.
Anndrea was so preoccupied with her painting she did not
hear her room mate come in, but knew she was there.
"What is it?" the other woman said.
Anndrea was not easily startled or distracted she took the
time to finish the area she was working on before turning her
attention.
"It's a Bald Eagle."
"I've heard of eagles before." said the woman "but I've
never seen a real one.Have you?"
Anndrea looked at her room mate.With short bright red hair
Janice was at the extreme opposite end of the scale then her.
"I took my leave of absence to work in a breading reserve
for these birds."
"I've only been to Earth for short vacations and shore
leave."Janice said as she took off her uniform jacket and
threw it on her bed."And, I've always spent that time shopping
in the big cities.I love discovering new cities."
"You've never spent any time visiting the Earth wilderness?"
"It just never seemed to be a priority.I've always been
fascinated by what people have built.Earth has such a rich
history, it's like traveling back in time."Janice had wandered
into the other room, she was laying on her bunk looking out at
Anndrea.
"I heard that you grew up on VEGA-5" Anndrea said while she
packed up her paints.
"Yea, I lived on the streets until I was twelve."Janice
replied uninterested.
"I would think that you would have had enough of cities."
She said as she secured the unfinished painting on a wall near a
finished picture of a traditional Native American encampment.
"Enough of cities?Are you nuts, cities are my home, I
don't feel comfortable without people around me."Janice had
rolled onto her back and was looking up at the ceiling, her
short red hair hung over the foot of her bunk.Painted on the
ceiling was the shadow of a coyote against a full moon.It was
Whitecloud's first contribution to decorating the room.Under
the painting Whitecloud had recently added a poem she'd found in
the computer's library.She thought it was from a collection
the Captain had up loaded.

Go to the Wild that waits for me;
Go where the moose and the musk-ox be;
Go to the wolf and the secret snows;
Go to my fate...who knows, who knows!
R.W.S.

"Tell me," Janice said "everybody know's how and why I came
to be here, what's your story?"
"It's not very interesting."Whitecloud said sitting on her
own bed across from Janice.
Janice sat up and looked at her room mate. "I'm interested."
she said.
"Well" Anndrea began "I was born on Earth in what is known
as a 'reservation'.Reservations are areas in North America
that were set aside for Native Americans to live as separate
cultural entities.Some still live traditional ancient
lifestyles and many are moving back to them.It is the current
thought that if you are not going to live a traditional
lifestyle, why live on the reservation.
"My parents, in fact my tribe, was obsessed with returning
to the ancient way of life.It was decided that it was
impossible to do on Earth.That the land was not suited for
people to be living off of it with out also depending on the
modern world.As a people, they decided to look else where for
a place to colonize in a 'traditional Native American culture'.
"The tribe applied to the Infiniti West Corporation for a
land grant.Since we were the first large traditional group to
apply to the I.W.C. for colonization we were granted a very
generous portion.In order to pay for transportation the tribe
sold it's lands and boarded a colony ship for Infiniti West.I
was two years old when we walked off our ancestral land for the
last time.My mother told me that ...."

....A darkly tanned teenage girl rode a tall brown horse
across an endless prairie.She rode bare back accept for the
bedroll and other camping supplies strapped behind her.She had
long, straight, black hair tied back by a thin leather thong
with a bright red feather hanging from it.She wore a simple
brown buck-skin dress decorated with small beads and fringe.
With her, rode two younger males both dressed in similar
primitive garb.
They topped a small hill and looked out over the endless
plain around them."How far do you think?" the older of the
boys asked the girl.
"We could be home late tonight." she said.
"I can't wait to tell them about the mountains" said the
younger boy.
"It's amazing, that after all these years, the tribe's never
gone that far east" said the first boy.
"It may have," replied the girl "we just don't remember."
"I'd think somebody would have mentioned mountains that
reach beyond the clouds." said the older boy.
The girl looked at the boy and said "We came here all the
way from EARTH."almost in awe of the fact. "Do you think that
any mountains would have impressed them?"
"You believe that?" the younger boy said "My brother told me
that the story about Earth and the Federation is just a campfire
story."
"Your brother is just a trouble maker, he's almost old
enough to remember." replied the girl.
"If this Federation tribe really existed then why have we
never seen them?" the younger boy insisted.
"Never seen them?" the girl looked astonished "what about
the ships we see in the sky at night?"
"I don't see ships," the boy continued repeating his
brother's words "I only see lights.We've just been told
they're ships, to keep us in line 'behave yourself, or we'll
send you up to the Federation'.Every parent uses that, they
say you just sparkle and disappear. I've never seen anybody just
sparkle and disappear, have you?"
During the conversation the older boy was looking to the
west in the direction they had been riding."What's that?" he
said pointing to the horizon.
A faint orange glow had appeared on the horizon and was
growing.
The girl looked at it for a second and said "I don't know,
but its getting bigger".
"It's not getting bigger," the older boy said "it's getting
closer.".
"It's a Space Ship!" the younger boy shouted excitedly.
As the ship got closer they could hear the roar of its
engines.It was wedge shaped and looked slightly battered.As
it got closer, it started to gain altitude.When it was over
them the three were jumping and waving at it.It seemed to
wiggle a bit as if it were waving back at them.Within minutes,
it had shrunk to a dot above them, then disappeared.
"Wow that was great." the younger boy said now in total awe.
"I thought you didn't believe in space ships." the girl said
with a laugh.
"I do now.What do you think it was doing here? I wonder if
the clan saw it"
"I would think so, It must have flown right over them." the
girl replied.
The older boy had turned toward the west again and was
squinting at the horizon.
"What is it," the other boy said "is there another one?".
"No."
"What is it?" the girl asked now looking back to the horizon
herself.
"I think I see smoke." the older boy said cautiously.
"That's impossible, we never build fires like that."
"I know, that's why I'm worried."
The girl leaned forward over her horse's neck and squinted
at the horizon."My God," she said "I see it too."
"That's were Camp should be." the older boy added.
They sat and looked at each other for a moment then kicked
their horses to a gallop.Heading toward a faint pillar of
smoke on the horizon in the mid-morning sun the trio rode harder
then they ever had.
As the day wore on, the smoke slowly dissipated but the
three still rode hard.With the sun settling on the ground
ahead of them the youths crested a hill over camp.Ahead of
them was what they feared most.The remains of tee-pees lay
smoldering where they had stood just a few days earlier.About
them lay their former possessions and other charred debris.
The trio sat on their horses staring at the scene, unmoving.
No one moved for minutes, finally the girl slid from her horse
and ran down the hill.The other two soon followed leaving the
three horses on the hill.
They instinctively ran to the places their own tents once
stood, but there was no sign of life.The youngest boy stood in
the middle of a smoldering black patch of earth, crying.The
older boy sat on a log next to his tent, his favorite place to
watch the sun set.The girl began examining the wreckage trying
to discover what had happened.
She finally looked closely at some of the blackened debris,
she barely recognized it as a person.
"Were are all the people?" she could hear the younger boy
say.
"They're right here." she whispered as the shock set in.
She heard some moaning but it wasn't coming from her friends
it was from someplace else.She straightened up and listen for
the sound, it was coming from the creek.
She ran to the bank but was afraid to look over, at first.
When she did, she wasn't sure what she saw.Laying in the mud
at the edge of the stream appeared to be a woman covered in mud
and grime.A large black holed was burned in her back and blood
poured from the many cuts and gouges over her body.As the girl
approached she thought she looked familiar but wasn't sure.It
wasn't until she recognized the remains of an anklet the woman
wore did she know whom she approached.
"Mom!" she cried and fell to her knees in the mud next to
the woman.
The woman opened her eyes, still bright and clear,
"Anndrea," she whispered "thank God you weren't here.."
Anndrea cradled her mother's head in her lap "don't worry
mom, you'll be all right, I promise." she said through her
tears.
"No dear," the woman choked "my time has come, I just ....
for you, my love."
"Who did this, why?" Anndrea gasped.
"Pirates...don't know why...just came." the woman turned to
look at her daughter."You must leave this place, this planet
has nothing left for you...promise me...go to the Fort...go to
the Federation .."
"I promise" the girl cried.
Bubbles of blood formed on the woman's lips as she exhaled
her last breath.

The three children sat on their horses over looking the
favorite summer valley of their clan.From behind them, the
morning sun cast long shadows in front of them towards their
past.They could not identify any of the rest of the clan, they
just left them where they were.Outside of the village circle
was the single grave they had spent the night digging.
Anndrea turned to her two friends and said "I'm going to the
Fort."
"Aren't you going with us to the other clan?" the older boy
asked.
"No, I promised I would leave, and that is what I'm going to
do."
"I want to leave too." the younger boy said as tears poured
down his face.
"You must find the other clan, that is where you belong.
The tribe must know of what has happened here."
They were all too tired to argue, they hugged each other
from their horses then parted ways.The girl headed north and
the two boys headed south.
A darkly tanned teenage girl rode a tall brown horseacross
an endless prairie.She rode bare back accept for the bedroll
and other camping supplies strapped behind her.She had long,
straight black hair tied back by a thin leather thong with a
bright red feather hanging from it.She wore a simple brown
buck-skin dress decorated with small beads and fringe.Ahead of
the girl was a large walled compound with two large doors
standing open, waiting for her....

Whitecloud never finished her sentence, just sat looking
into the room.
'What ever happened to her on Infiniti West must still be
too hard to speak of' O'Malley thought.Janice sat next to
Anndrea and held her while she cried for her memories.Even
warriors were allowed to cry, occasionally.
Anndrea sat up pushed her hair out of her face "I have my
first solo command in a few hours, I'd better start prepareing."
she stood and went into the head.

-----------

"Captain Anthony, Sir, I read a ship entering this sector."
It was O'Malley's turn to stand watch on the sensors.
"Can you project a course for it yet?" the Captain asked
from the Command room.
"Yes Sir, it's current trajectory will bring it on a tangent
to this system.They won't need to alter their course until the
last minute to enter.At current warp ETA is, 5 hours 15
minutes."
"Keep an eye on them, if they show any sign of actually
paying this system a visit let me know."
"Aye, sir"
Several hours later Captain Anthony sat in his quarters
reviewing deployment scenarios submitted by Lt Commanders
Kartang and Golta when the yellow alert signal light came on.
At the same time there was the piping sound on the ship wide
communications followed by commander Tarva saying"Captain
Anthony, report to the bridge."
Anthony hit his comm button and said "I'm on my way." then
headed into the hall.Two meters down the hall a turbo lift
stood opened waiting for him.When he entered, the door shut
quickly and the lift accelerated toward the bridge without
command.
"Commander Tarva, Report." Anthony said as soon as he
stepped off the lift.
The rest of the main bridge crew was already at their
stations.
"Sir, the incoming ship has continued its course on a
tangent to this system but we have picked up extremely intense
scanners directed towards the system.The yellow alert was
automatically activated by ACT.It seems that the system
perceives these scans as a threat and has begun shifting the
cloaking frequencies to compensate." Tarva reported.
"Automatic frequency shifting is designed to compensate for
the intense Borg scanners." Anthony said as he took his chair.
Then after some thought asked "Do we have a make on the ship
yet?"
"Sir all we have is that it's a Federation Pentalia class,
perhaps a scout ship." Ensign O'Malley reported.
"Sir, there are no Federation scanner systems that would
cause ACT to automatically initiate phase frequency shifting of
the cloaking." Commander Norton said.
"Perhaps, you should say there are no systems that we are
aware of." Anthony commented with a smile.
"That, would be more accurate." Norton agreed.
"Perhaps we should bring in any training missions we have
out." Tarva suggested.
"Agreed." Commander Norton said then signaled the 'Cavern'
"Lieutenant Commander Kartang, are there any training teams
planet side?"
"A drop ship is collecting the last team at this time."
Kartang replied.
"Please keep us appraised of their progress."
"Aye Sir, Kartang out."
"Sir," Ensign O'Malley said "the ship has dropped out of
warp and is concentrating it's scans on this area."
"That's not possible," Tarva said "it couldn't possibly read
us from that distance and there's no way it could see the team
on the surface."
"Have all hands prepare for silent running." Anthony said to
Tarva then to Norton "Have they zeroed in on anything yet?"
"No sir, they just keep doing wide sweeps, like their seeing
shadows or something."
"Ensign O'Malley what's their current status?" Anthony
turned to the red head.
"Sir, they're heading toward us now at three quarters
impulse, they should be here in about forty eight minutes."
"I read a high energy release on the planet" Norton
reported.
"Bridge, Drop Ship Control here." came Kartang's voice over
the intercom.
"Go ahead." replied Commander Tarva.
"Sir, Drop Ship 21 has crashed on lift off" Kartang said
almost frantically.
"Survivors?" Captain Anthony demanded.
"With the storm and the ACT systems in the ship and suits it
is impossible to tell.Sir, request permission to launch a
rescue mission!"
"How many unaccounted for?"
"Two pilots and a full sixteen member landing team."
"Sir," O'Malley Interrupted "The ship has increased to full
impulse and has a projected course to enter our exact orbit.
New ETA five minutes."
"They have concentrated full scanner activity on the area of
the crash site."Norton added.
Anthony swung his command chair around to get a full look at
his bridge crew.All, like himself, were strapped into their
duty chairs in preparation for silent running."Mr. Norton,
initiate silent running.Mr. Kartang, permission denied, send a
message to any survivors to hang tight we'll come get them as
soon as possible.Helm take us to an opposite geo-synchronous
orbit, maybe we can repeat that incident with the Raptor."
The Vigilante adjusted it's current geo-synchronous orbit
over their training area to one directly on the opposite side of
the planet.The movement was so smooth it was not perceptible
to any of the crew.
"Sir, I'm picking up a transmission from the surface, audio
only." Norton said.
"Put it on the speaker"
The speakers for the view screen immediately erupted in
static."This is the best I can do" Norton said as he made
adjustments.
A female voice could barely be heard through the noise:
<Vigilante...twelve...survive...suits held..one day...failure..>
the rest of the message was inaudible.
"What are they doing, don't they know we have company?"
Tarva said.
"They did not acknowledge our warnings to them just before
the crash." Norton advised her.
"Sir, the Ship has taken up orbit where predicted, and they
have shields at maximum." Norton reported.He then made new
adjustments at the comm center "I now have a transmission from
the ship, directed to the planet."
The sound was much cleaner and a male voice said:
<Attention planet side, this is the U.S.S. Delphi, please
identify yourselves, we are prepared to offer assistance if
needed.>
Anthony immediately turned to Commander Norton and said "Get
me all you can on the Delphi and the Pentalia class ships."
"Aye, Sir." Norton said as he started working his console.
"Captain," O'Malley spoke up "The Delphi has transported an
away team to the planet."
"How close to our people is their team?" Tarva asked.
"Can't tell, the armor is deflecting our scans."
There had been a long pause from the planet then the high
static began again and the female voice came back:

 <This...private registry trans...Vigi..., request evacuat...six
survive.>

"My God, they've lost twelve." Ensign O'Malley whispered.
"If they get evacuated, they'll initiate Drop Ship self
destruct." Tarva said.She then turned to the intercom and
signaled Chief Swanson.

<Say again, how many survivors?Our scans do not indicate
any lifesigns.>

"Swanson, here." came a woman's voice.
"Chief, we need to beam aboard all personnel on the far side
of the planet, can we do it?" Tarva said quickly.
"We're currently out of range, sir."
"Damn, the planet's in the way" Anthony said "Helm, move us
into transport range best speed."
"Aye, Sir." replied the helmsman.
"Prepare to transport." Tarva said to the intercom then
immediately started entering timings and frequencies to
coordinate the transport.

After another long pause, the voice came back:
<...sheltered...debris. There...six, repeat six...request...
evacuation...>
<Confirmed, we now read six survivors, prepare for emergency
transport.>

O'Malley then reported "The survivors of the Drop Ship have
been transported, the away team is still on the planet."
"Tarva to Chief Swanson prepare to transport."
"Watching for the signal, now." she replied.
"Sir," Norton said "I have the specs for the Pentalia class
ships but I'm unable to find any registry for the Delphi, in any
class."
"Who ever they are, they have six of my crew."Anthony then
turned to his intercom "Mr Kartang, I'll need a roster for the
team and drop ship crew we just misplaced."
"Aye, Sir."
Captain Anthony saw a note immediately appear on his log
screen:Drop Ship 21 Crew and Roster.

Six figures appeared in a standard Federation transporter
room.A female Klingon and a male Kalonian stood on either
side, 2 human males were kneeling over the form of a Vulcan.
They all had portable full-face breathers strapped or held to
their faces.
The sixth stood in the center of the semicircle.She was a
female with shoulder length straight black hair and had the
portable breather strapped properly over her face.All six wore
one piece, snug fitting, flat gray body suits with wires and
connectors sticking out from them.
The woman made an obvious move towards a tricorder-like
device she was holding.She managed to press one button.
A security officer saw this and yelled "Look out,she's got
a weapon!" and fired his phaser at her.

Robert W. Service





Six figures appeared in a standard Federation transporter
room.A female Klingon and a male Kalonian stood on either
side of 2 human males who were kneeling over the form of a
Vulcan.They all had portable, full-face breathers strapped or
held to their faces.
The sixth stood in the center of the semicircle.She
was a female with shoulder length straight black hair and
had the portable breather strapped properly over her face.
All six wore one piece, snug fitting, flat gray body suits
with wires and connectors sticking out from them.
The woman made an obvious move towards a tricorder-like
device she was holding.She managed to press one button.
A security officer saw this and yelled "Look out,she's
got a weapon!" and fired his phaser at her.
The doors to the transporter room snapped opened and a blue
skinned Andorian rushed in, phaser in hand.He was just in time
to see the Klingon female pull off her mask, growling, and rush
toward the security man.
The Andorian's shot hit first as the security man's second
shot immediately followed.The Klingon grunted and dropped to
one knee.
"Identify yourselves." the Andorian hissed, his antennae
twitching slightly.
Anndrea Whitecloud looked at the blue-skinned figure.Blue
antennae protruded from his white hair.His teeth were bared
and gleamed white.She watched as his thumb clicked on the
phaser, she knew that he was increasing the setting.
The transporter room had quite a few other people in it.
The most prominent were the mustard-yellow of security although
there were a couple of blue-shirts and the red-shirted
blue-skinned humanoid.
"We have injured. Get your doctors to work." Whitecloud
demanded.
The Andorian hissed as he motioned to the doctor and her
assistant. He was about to address the female when a Yeoman
interrupted him.
"Sir! Bridge reports that a high intensity explosion has
just been registered on the planet's surface."
"Coordinates? The team? " he was veritably snarling.
"Bridge reports no survivors." he continued "Sir, I believe
that she activated some form of detonation device."
Bronsdale piped in, "Sir, she just killed Assali, Meede and
Albert!"
"You had no business in putting an away team down there."
Whitecloud said.
The Andorian motioned with his hand."Add extra security,
even to those in sickbay." his voice deathly quiet, his gaze
locked with that of Whitecloud.The doctor began moving the
others out.
"But sir!! She is responsible for ..."
A beam from the Andorian's phaser cut the man short sending
him senseless.He then stared back at the female remaining on
the transporter pad."That is quite enough Yeoman", he hissed.
"And that is quite enough as well, LIEUTENANT Qhasmon, you
will return to the bridge NOW, I will speak with you later."
A new man stepped into the transporter room. Now, only
himself and three security men remained in the room with
Whitecloud.One of the three was the unconscious form of the
man the Andorian had shot.
Whitecloud instinctively came to attention when she saw the
pips in the man's collar.His features were almost youthful,
save for the steely glint in his blue eyes and the firmness he
had held in his voice.
"Sir, the woman ..."one of the men began.
"That is enough Yeoman Upaw. I am aware of the situation."
The Captain was terse with the Yeoman.
The Captain looked at the woman, she appeared to be about as
tall as he, around 5' 8".She had darkly tanned skin and
straight black hair, her eyes were dark and defiant.She had
sharp angular features that would be considered beautiful and
exotic in almost any human culture, as well as some non-human
ones.
"Your name, please." The Captain said formally.
"Anndrea Smith." She was not a very creative liar.
"Very well, 'Ms. Smith', Security officer Seneschal will
escort you to medical, then we shall meet.We have much to
discuss."
"Yes, Sir." she replied reflexively.
The Captain stared ahead at the transporter, feeling older.
He was aware of the Yeoman at the transporter control panel.
"Attend to Mr. .... Bronsdale.." Captain Percival Malory turned
and left, leaving Upaw to help a now groggy Yeoman Bronsdale.

--------------

Chief Swanson watched the three appear on the transporter.
She still found it difficult to get used to the speed of these
new transporters.There was minimal of the standard sparkling,
the subject just suddenly appeared.
The landing party appeared in very unusual poses, they were
covering or averting their eyes as if from a bright light.She
wasn't surprised, however, since she had to time it extremely
close.She not only had to wait for the destruct command from
the Drop Ship survivors, but also had to time it so she pulled
them out just before the effects of the explosion reached them.
Otherwise, the Delphi may have noticed them 'die' early and
investigate further which is something they were trying to
avoid.
"Excellent timing," the shortest one began as he pulled off
his helmet.When he got it clear he looked at the tall blond
female human standing behind the control panel."Who are you,
and why have you brought us here?".
"Sir," another said "I don't think this is the Delphi."
They all instinctively reached for their phasers, the short one
finding his first.
"I wish you wouldn't do that." said a voice from the door.
It was a medium-built, bald, pointed-eared humanoid who was also
wearing the same baggy black uniform.With him, was half a
dozen others all wearing the same uniform.They carried large,
strange looking phasers and wore no rank insignia.The little
insignia they were wearing, however, did appear to be standard
Star Fleet.
"Mister, I demand an explanation, who are you people?." said
the tallest of the three.
At the same time the short human was trying to raise the
Delphi on his communicator.
"That won't be necessary," said the Vulcan, "this room is
quite shielded."
The man continued to try to contact his ship but to no
avail.The three didn't lower their weapons, at first, while
they assessed the situation.What finally forced their decision
was not the security pointing their own phasers at them, but the
transporter chief holding her hand over a button on the console.
Anyone with respect for the transporter, knew better than to get
an operator disturbed with them while standing on the pad.
As soon as they lowered their phasers two of the six who had
entered with the Volcan circulated relieving them of their
equipment.They then took off the remainder of their
environmental suits.
"Now I'd like to welcome you aboard, I'm Commander Norton"
the Vulcan said."I apologize for abruptly transporting you
like we did.But the Captain didn't see any other option."
The tallest stepped forward and said "I am Commander Assali,
First Officer of the U.S.S. Delphi."he then indicated the
others "and these are Lieutenant Meede, and Midshipmen Albert.
Now, we'd like to know just who you people are, who's in charge
and why we can not contact our ship."
"All in due time, Commander." Norton said "Now if you'd
follow these men to your temporary quarters.I'm sure, that
after that storm you'd like to get cleaned up."
"Sir," Commander Assali said the word sarcastically "We are
not going anywhere until we get some answers."
Norton hesitated for a minute then produced an old style
communicator from one his large pockets and spoke quietly into
it.When he was finished he snapped it shut and dropped it back
into the pocket."Commander, All I am authorized to tell you,
at this time, is that The Delphi stumbled onto a top secret Star
Fleet project during a training accident.Much information
beyond that, would make you and your crew extremely difficult to
safely release, especially if your going to be stationed in this
quadrant."
"I'm sorry, that is not sufficient, Sir." Lieutenant Meede
said.
Norton thought for a second then said "Okay if that's the
way you want it.Chief Swanson, I'd like you to totally disable
the transporter in this room." He then turned to one of his men
and said "Make sure all computer interface is disconnected
except for the food replicator.
"Gentlemen, this is not one of the more comfortable quarters
to billet in and the head has minimal wash facilities.But
since this is were you wish to remain, we're flexible."
The three turned and whispered among themselves then Assali
turned back to Commander Norton "Standard quarters will be
sufficient until such time we are returned to the Delphi."
The Vulcan smiled and said "Very good".

The security personnel escorted the three out of the
transporter room.On the trip to their quarters they saw a some
more of the ship.The hallways were narrow, spartin, and purely
utilitarian.The room next to the transporter room they arrived
in, had another transporter.They could see as they walked by
that the room was extremely large and had several large open
doors into it.It appeared to have facilities to transport over
one hundred personnel at a time, but that seemed ridiculous.
They arrived at the door to a billet, which slid open
crisply to admit them."The quarters in this section are
designed for four occupants.The replicators can provide for
any of your needs, so make yourselves comfortable."said one of
the guards.
"We are confined to these quarters?" asked the Lieutenant.
"In essence, yes" said the security guard. "The Captain and
First Officer would like to speak to you soon and hopefully
answer some of your questions"At that, the guards waited for
their guests to enter their quarters and then took their
stations on either side of the door.

-----------

"Sir, We have the transmission from Star Base 89" said the
Delphi's communications officer, Lt. Penthrach.
"Thank you Mr Penthrach" Captain Malory said to his intercom
in his ready room.He then sat back in his chair and punched
the files up on his console. He had been awaiting this
transmission since getting the retina scans.
Each file was accompanied by the usual poor quality visual.
Captain Malory browsed through the first page of each file.

Captain Malory reread the information, then made a decision.

 ----------

"Who are these people?" Lieutenant Meede stormed.
"We'll find out soon enough." Commander Assali said coolly.
"We need to exercise utmost caution. We have been abducted
by an unknown force.This clearly constitutes a hostile act.
If these were Star Fleet officers, they sure as HELL wouldn't
treat other officers in such a manner.I suggest we make mental
preparations for becoming hostages... That 'Commander Norton',
looked suspiciously Romulan to me..."

The storm had left them quite grimy even under the
environment suits so they were taking turns using the head.
Midshipman Albert came walking out freshly showered.The two
officers were too busy planning to get cleaned up so he had
taken the first shift in the shower, it did feel good.Since
his uniform had gotten quite dirty, he ordered a fresh one from
the replicator.Before putting it on he took some time to look
through the drawers near the replicator.
"Sirs, you might want to see this." he pulled out a
laminated card that was stuck in the back of one of the draws.

Welcome aboard the U.S.S. Vigilante.

--- There will be a mandatory meeting for all personnel at
0830 in shuttle bay 1.This should give all a chance to
get settled.All crew assignments will be handed out at
this time.

--- Ship's uniforms are available from the replicators in
each room just program required size.Standard Star
Fleet issue boots are appropriate. (a slight wait may be
necessary, full power is currently not on line)

--- Please make yourself as comfortable as possible,
as soon as more quarters are finished they will be
assigned.

The two officers looked at the card then Assali said "It
really doesn't tell us much.Except maybe the name of the
ship."
"It fits" Meede interjected "That original hail we
heard was garbled, but could have been directed towards a
vessel named 'Vigilante'."
"Sirs, perhaps you should use the showers before they decide
to talk to us." Albert suggested.
"Thank you Mr Albert, I almost forgot"Assali said as he
turned toward the head.

Assali, Meede, and Albert were escorted through the
corridors of the Vigilante.The three were perfectly groomed in
standard Star Fleet uniforms.The few others they saw in the
hallways wore the same baggy, black uniform with several large
'cargo' pockets.Everyone they saw walked crisply and stiff,
all seemed to be overly disciplined and didn't ever give them a
second glance.
Meede raised an eyebrow at this behavior. His abductors had
just moved up several notches on his personal 'danger scale'.

They were lead into a good sized room for the ones they had
glimpsed.It was flat gray like the rest of the ship with a
U-shaped table that had eight chairs at it.Other chairs were
also placed around the perimeter of the room.In the center of
the U was a single chair positioned to face all seated at the
table.
"Its a court room." Assali said after they had stood in it
for a minute.
"Are we being put a trial?" Albert asked.
Meede simply scowled.
Just then the door slid open and Commander Norton walked in
accompanied by a short Kalonian female and a good sized human
male.The man was almost 2 meters tall, had relatively wide
shouders and long graying black hair thinning on top and pulled
back into a pony tail.
Meede looked at the man then said "I thought you were dead,"
he hesitated for a moment, and then added "Sir."
"It's good to see you again too, Mr Meede" the man said.
Assali turned to the Lieutenant "You know this man?".
"Yes sir, I served briefly under him aboard the Nielsen
before I was promoted to the Charlemagne."
"Wasn't the Nielsen part of the armada destroyed at
Wolf-359?" Albert asked.
"Please Allow me to introduce myself," the man said,
ignoring the question, and offered his had to Assali "I'm
Captain Anthony and I'd like to personally welcome you aboard
the U.S.S. Vigilante," he then indicated the Kalonian with him
"and this is my first officer, Commander Tarva."
She didn't offer her hand, just slightly nodded toward them.
"Now, I suppose you have a lot of questions, why don't you
have a seat and we'll see if we can answer any of them." Anthony
indicated the chairs at the table as he and Commander Tarva
headed for them.
"Sir, if you really are a commissioned Star Fleet ship, why
have you not allowed us to contact the Delphi?" Meede asked
before everybody was fully seated.
"I thought that would be the first question you'd ask."
Anthony said with a grin."As I'm sure Mr Norton has advised
you, the U.S.S. Vigilante is a top secret project.We are under
strict orders not to reveal ourselves to anybody.We are to
remain anonymous until such time we have completed the mission
for which we were designed and are training for.If we were to
simply allow you to call the Delphi that would be in direct
violation of one of our primary mission directives."
"Its interesting that our sensors didn't directly detect you
as we approached the planet ...", Assali lead.
"As I've said, we are an experimental ship, I really can't
get into our 'stealth' capabilities."
The three sat and looked at each other for a minute.
"Captain, aren't you concerned that the Delphi is looking for
us?"Commander Assali asked somewhat incredulously.
Tarva fielded this one "We were aware that the remains of
the transport that had crashed would be destroyed after the
survivors were evacuated.We pulled you off the planet just
before you would have been vaporized by the blast.Hopefully,
the Delphi will think that you were killed."
"Hopefully, they'll think we were killed?You want them to
abandon us?Then what, you keep us against our will, kill us
yourselves, what?"Meede had assumed his head of security
authoritative tone.
Tarva had been a security Chief for too long to be impressed
by Meede's posturing.After a few months of him, Anthony
had also become use to it.
Anthony replied "Lieutenant, our intention was to keep you
from harm, if we wanted you dead, we would have ignored you."
"Which we almost did." Tarva lied.
Assali had been quietly listening to the exchange and
finally spoke up."The way I see it then, you are looking
for some way to exchange us for your missing crew without
revealing yourselves.Does that sum up the situation? "
"Most of it." Anthony said.
"There is a bit more we must accomplish to clean up this
incident properly."Tarva added.
"And that is?" Meede asked.
"We must insure that all computer and other records of the
Delphi's foray into AR-24 are erased or altered to exclude any
and all contact with the Vigilante and her personnel."Tarva
replied casually.
Midshipman Albert blurted out "That's impossible...Sir."he
then turned to Assali "Sir, Captain Malory would never go for
altering the computer records, would he?"
Tarva looked at Assali "Is the Captain of the Delphi
Percival Malory?"
Assali scrutinized the recognition in Tarva's face "Yes,
Percival Malory is the Captain of the U.S.S. Delphi, do you know
him?"
"After Wolf-359, the New Aukland rescued me from an escape
pod.The Captain was Percival Malory, we actually became quite
good friends." She said this more to Anthony than Commander
Assali.
Anthony turned to Tarva "Between Commander Assali and
yourself we may be able to convince Captain Malory...."
"Hold that thought," Assali interrupted "convince Captain
Malory about what, I'm not convinced myself. You're going to
have to tell and show me a lot more than you have so far to get
me to try to convince my Captain to do something that is
strictly against policy."
"Sir," Meede said to Assali "Are you saying that you may
even be considering asking Captain Malory to forge his logs?"
"Lieutenant," Anthony said "You must learn to look beyond
the rules and regulations of an individual ship to the security
of the entire Federation."
Meede scoffed "Are you trying to tell us that this project
is that important?"
"We are." Tarva answered seriously.
Assali motioned for Meede to remain silent and thought for a
moment."Let's try to compromise some here.Show me what you
can of this ship.If you convince me, then I'll do what I can.
At no time, however, will I involve myself in lying to or
attempting to deceive my commanding officer, is that clear."

A pipping sound came from the intercom."Bridge to Captain
Anthony."
"Go ahead."
"Sir, We read the Delphi powering up, she's probably
preparing to get under way." came a female voice.
"Have we obtained our new orbit?" Tarva said to the speaker.
"Yes, sir."
"Very good, we'll be right up." Anthony stood followed by
the rest at the table."Mr Norton, would you have someone
escort Lieutenant Meede and Mr Albert back to their quarters."
Norton who had remained standing by the door acknowledged
the command with a slight nod and a "Yes, Sir".
Anthony toward Assali "Won't you please accompany me to the
Bridge?"
"Sir, I must protest," Meede interjected "I don't know that
we should allow ourselves to be split up by these people."
"Mr Meede," Assali turned to the man "If we were not safe,
there's not much we could do about it.So I suggest we take
them at face value until they give us reason to believe
otherwise.Is that clear?"
"Yes, sir"
"Now, return to our quarters and wait for me."
With that, the two groups exited the briefing room.

-----------

Andrea Whitecloud wore a standard yellow Star Fleet
uniform with no rank or insignia.She sat at one end of a table
in a relatively large conference room.Sitting at the table
were the remaining command staff of the USS Delphi.Among them
were of course Captain Malory, Doctor Mayak and the second in
command of security, now chief of security, Lieutenant Anna
Zalvosta.
"Ms. Smith" the Captain was saying "Let me get this
straight, you claim that you and your crew are the survivors of
a private registry transport?"
"That's correct."
"And the name of the transport was The Vigilante"
"Actually it was the Klingon equivalent, but essentially
yes."
"Don't you think that VIGILANTE is a rather severe name for
a transport?" Malory was calmly paging through notes on his
terminal, notes totally unrelated to what was going on at
present.
"Not for the make up of the crew."Whitecloud leaned
casually to one side with her hands laying loosely in her lap.
"Now there's something I'd like to talk about." Malory said
as if suddenly finding something interesting. "It is most
intriguing, that you accomplished getting a Kalonian and a
Klingon to work together.The only time I've ever seen some in
a room together, they were trying to kill each other.
"It's amazing how much hatred and prejudices can be put
aside if the price is right."Whitecloud seemed bored with the
whole process.
"Then your cargo was extremely valuable?"
"Some would think so."
"What exactly was your cargo?"
"An assortment of things."
Malory seemed to ignore her answers and just continued
with his questions "If it was so valuable, why did you destroy
it."
"Who said I destroyed it?"
"Then what was that you were doing with the tri-corder after
you were beamed up?" interjected the new chief of security.
"I was in the process of activating a homing beacon when we
were transported, I was just trying to finish what I had
started."
"That was some homing beacon." Lieutenant Zalvosta said
incredulously.
"The tricorder must have malfunctioned when YOUR man lost
his cool.The tri-corder also had a destruct function in it,
but that is not what I was activating."
"Once again you try to blame US for the death of the away
team." Malory was starting to show some slight agitation.
"I lost more then THREE comrades in that crash, I have to
live with that.I am not going to accept the blame for the
death of three people who were some place they shouldn't have
been when someone else caused a malfunction.As far as I'm
concerned, I'm more of a witness than a participant to the
matter."Whitecloud had straighten out and had both hands palms
down on the table and was staring directly at Malory.
Before Malory could respond a piping sound came over the
intercom."Captain, Bridge here".
"Go a head Mr Qhasmon."
"Sir, we are ready to get under way."
"Stand by.", Malory rose and stood for a moment beside his
chair, gazing at his 'guest'.
"I am sure that we will speak again, Miss...Smith, before we
reach Star Base 89 at any rate...."
"Starbase 89?" Whitecloud asked.
"Yes, the Admiral has shown a specific interest in you and
your crew." Malory clapped his hand atop his chair and abruptly
left the meeting room.

-----------

"One thing still puzzles me.." Assali said to Anthony as
they entered the turbo-lift to the bridge.
"What's that?BRIDGE" Captain Anthony stood in a casual at
ease posture.
Assali's knees buckled slightly from the extreme
acceleration of the lift."I've been trying to figure out why
none of our sensors spotted your ship and why we had such a hard
time zeroing in on your crew."
"Mr Assali," Anthony said in mock shock."Like we've said,
this is a secret project it wouldn't do us any good if any
passing Star Ship could see us, Would it?"The door to the
turbo lift opened and Assali and Anthony stepped onto the
bridge.
On the main screen was the image of the Delphi.The
Vigilante had come up behind and above it.The angle and the
distance made the single warp drive ship seem extremely small.
"My God," Assali said "you're cloaked, aren't you?."
Anthony smiled "Yea, I suppose we are.Ensign O'Malley
report."
"Sir, the Delphi has maintained its shields and appears to
be preparing to leave orbit."
"If they leave orbit, we're going to have a tougher time
fixing this problem."Anthony stood behind O'Malley looking at
the ship on the screen.
"What were your plans with my ship?" Assali asked concerned.
Anthony looked at the Delphi's first officer "It doesn't
matter, Malory seems to be playing it safe."
"He does seem to have a sixth sense"Assali agreed with a
smile.He knew that Malory was anything but safe in his style
of Captaining.
Tarva walked up behind them from the other lift "That does
seem to be a major requirement for a Star Fleet Captain."
The Delphi changed its orbit and vectored away from the
planet.It made an abrupt half turn and changed course for a
little more than an instant. Then it resumed its course and
heading.Within seconds it was out of sight as it increased to
maximum impulse power.
"What kind of maneuver was that?" Anthony asked curiously.
Assali smiled "I call it a 'Crazy Qhasmon'"
"What's the point?" Anthony was not satisfied.
Assali merely shrugged his shoulders.
"You know Andorians ..." he offered.
A Vulcan seated at the science station along the rear
perimeter of the bridge spoke up "Sir,"
"Yes, Lieutenant S'Erlet."The Captain turned his attention
to his young Science Officer.
"I have been monitoring the Delphi as closely as possible. I
have ... noted ... that it seems to have a very sophisticated
scanner emission pattern.There seems to be some problems with
it however, as periodically, the scanner bandwith gets flooded
with garbage.Akin to resonance echoes, Sir.
"I would think that this may lead to some problems with
their navigational sensors. "
Tarva didn't quite agree with S'Erlet's opinion, "I doubt
that a Captain would have his ship prepare for warp speed if he
felt that his sensorswere faulty ...."Tarva kept her other
suspicions silent.
Assali continued to remain sailent on their speculations.
"Ensign O'Malley, at current course what is their best
destination?"Anthony asked.
"Sir, current course will set them directly to Star Base
89."
Anthony turned to Assali "Commander, would Star Base 89 be
an appropriate destination for the Delphi at this time?"
Assali continued to simply stand mute.
"What would be the average cruising speed of a Pentalia
class ship?"
"Warp six" Tarva replied.
"Plot a wide course to Star Base 89 best speed.We'll just
go and wait for them." Anthony said.
"Best speed, Sir?" O'Malley confirmed.
"Best Speed" Tarva confirmed.
"Aye, Sir." O'Malley worked a few buttons."Course plotted
and laid in, Sir"
"Engage." Anthony stood casually with his hands in his
jacket pockets.
The helmsman next to O'Malley pushed a few buttons and the
Vigilante vectored out of orbit just like the Delphi except for
the 'Crazy Qhasmon'."Full impulse" he reported.
"We're clear for warp" O'Malley said after a couple minutes.
"Engage." Tarva said from the Captain's chair.
The star field on the screen suddenly blurred to the
standard 'rushing stars' optical illusion of warp."Best Speed
attained." the helmsman said immediately.
"Very good, notify me when we arrive at Star Base 89."
Anthony then turned to Assali "Won't you join me in the briefing
room?" and headed toward a door near one of the Turbo Lifts.
Assali turned and followed the Captain off the bridge.

Anthony had to layout their mission to Assali in some
detail.He, however, did not tell him of the new technology or
how they planned to get to the Borg in a timely manner.The
fewest number of details revealed the better, if only he could
totally convince Assali.
The toughest part was getting Assali to agree to try to
convince Malory on his word alone with out revealing the
Vigilante or its nature.
Assali still didn't have any idea what the ship looked like.
All windows he'd seen merely looked into empty space and Anthony
was very tight lipped about details of the ship.
"Captain," Assali said "You have more or less convinced me
of your sincerity and the importance of your mission.My
question remains, how are you going to contact the Delphi or
alter it's logs after it arrives at Star Base 89?"
"Actually near a Star Base a Star Ship is likely to have
minimum security especially when it comes to having its shields
lowered for transport."
"And what do you plan to do when the Delphi lowers its
shields?" Assali was again showing proper concern for his ship.
Anthony smiled and said "Not the same thing we would have
done if they had dropped their shields at AR-24."
Assali scowled at the evasion.
"Okay, here's my plan, since it involves you and will
require your help..."

-----------

Whitecloud had been assigned a small but nice room.In
fact, it was a lot nicer than what she had on the Vigilante, but
it wasn't home.She had been allowed only limited contact with
the rest of her crew, they were being treated equally well.She
wondered with a flashing grin how close their stories were to
hers.
Anndrea Whitecloud had lost faith in a Supreme Being since
she was disenchanted on Infiniti West, now she found herself
praying that The Vigilante had picked up the Delphi's landing
party.With the death of S'Turlek she had lost a total of 13 of
the original 18.It would be difficult for even a seasoned
commander to deal with, it being her first solo command made it
even more difficult.
Whitecloud walked to her door which she had to signal to
have the guard open.A guard stood in the doorway looking at
her "What do you want?" he said.
"I Was told that you had exercise facilities that could be
made available to me." Whitecloud said as pleasantly as she
could.
"One moment" he said cursly.She could see him reach to his
communicator pin as the door slid shut between them.
A few moments later the door slid open again and the guard
still stood in the same position. "Facilities are currently
available, are you ready at this time?"
"Yes, that would be fine" she grabbed the bag of exercise
clothes she had been issued and headed out the door.A pair of
guards fell in behind her.

Anndrea had been working out on the strength training
equipment for about ten minutes when a couple of young security
officers, not that she had seen an older security officer on the
DELPHI yet, entered the rec room.
"You're the one, aren't you?" one of them said as they
approached.
Whitecloud who had been in a reclined position sat up and
pushed hair off of her face."I'm sorry were you talking to me,
Ensign?" she said in an authoritative voice.
"Your the one who killed the away team.What are you doing
in here?Shouldn't you be in the brig?" one of them said
harshly.
"What caused that terrible accident is still under
investigation." Whitecloud said as she stood up.
"Were the hell do you think your going?" the other said and
pushed Whitecloud hard enough to make her sit back down on the
bench."You kill two security officers and the First Officer,
now your in the security training room acting like you own the
place."
Whitecloud stood up quickly and stared at the speaker then
hissed "Mister, if you touch me again, I will KILL you, is that
understood?"
The other one grabbed her by the arm and spun her towards
him as he said "How dare you threaten Star Fleet officers".
Whitecloud grabbed the man's arm, pulled him free of her and
twisted the arm around his back.The man groaned from the
sudden stretch then screamed as his arm and shoulder broke and
and his arm started to double back on itself.
As soon as his friend screamed the other man rushed at them.
Whitecloud kicked straight out at him landing square in the
chest doubling him over and throwing him across the room.
Whitecloud stood behind the man and continued applying
pressure.As he screamed she whispered icily "Death is easy if
you know how to apply it."
In response to the man's screams, the guards had come
running into the room."What's going on here!" one of them
yelled as they approached.
Whitecloud let the man go and pushed him to the floor."Why
did you let these two in, you know I'm not allowed company."
One guard held a phaser on Whitecloud while the other knelt
down to examine the security man she had just released.His arm
was still twisted up behind his back and he lay on his stomach
moaning.The guard with the phaser touched his communicator pin
and said "Security and medical to Security Training Room one."

-----------

Anndrea Whitecloud stood in the conference room in a stiff
at ease posture.Seated at the table were Captain Malory, Chief
of Security Anna Zalvosta, and Doctor Mayak.Standing to either
side of Whitecloud but against the walls were two large security
men.
"Ms. Smith," Malory began "we are here to determine the
circumstances around the incident earlier today in the Training
Room.In your own words what exactly happened there today?"
"Sir, I was approached at a time when I was led to believe
that I was to remain segregated from the rest of your crew."
Whitecloud began "They accosted me in a rough and threatening
manner.I told these ENSIGNS to leave me alone, instead they
persisted in confronting me.Since they were not suppose to be
there, I knew they didn't just 'happen on me'.They had planned
to confront me and were in collusion with my guards.It was
obvious that they had plans for me, I was not about to allow
them to follow through."
"The Ensigns of course, tell a different story." Captain
Malory said "I tend to believe the truth is some where in the
middle."
"Captain, Sir," Lieutenant Zalvosta said "do you believe
that four Star Fleet officers are lying?"
The Captain turned to his new Chief of Security "I believe
that both parties' perceptions of events may be slightly
clouded."Then to Mayak "Doctor, what is the status of the
injured crewman?"
The doctor looked down at a chart in front of her "The
gentleman with the injured arm should be pretty much healed in a
day or two.His arm, however, may never be exactly right, but
we'll see.The other merely had the wind knocked out of him,
he's fine."
"Thank you, Doctor.Ms Zalvosta inform all personnel
involved that appropriate disciplinary action will be taken."
Malory then spoke to the whole room "Ms Smith please take a
seat, the rest are dismissed."
"But Sir..." one of Whitecloud's guards started.
"But nothing, everyone is dismissed I wish to talk privately
with Ms Smith."
"Aye, Sir." the other guard said and they headed out of the
room with the rest.
After Whitecloud had taken a seat across from Malory he said
"Lieutenant Whitecloud, I believe it is time we ended this
charade."
"I'm sorry, you must have me mistaken for somebody else."
Whitecloud said calmly.
Malory pushed a few buttons on the console in front of him.
The screen at one end of the room came on with the first page of
Whitecloud's file from Star Base 89.The visual was poor, as
was standard, but it was obviously Whitecloud. "Are you trying
to deny that this is you."
Whitecloud thought for a second and said very seriously
"Sir, I'm hoping you will realize that the persons in those
files can't be on this ship."
"I must know why three of my best officers were killed.I
have a lot of questions I need answered, before I can accept
that you were never here."
"Tell me what you have." Whitecloud seemed to be offering to
answer the questions.
Malory paged through his notes on the terminal for a few
minutes while he considered the options.Finally he said "The
explosion?"
"We could not leave top secret equipment to be found by
anybody.Policy."
"What really happened?"
"You stumbled on to a top secrete project just when things
weren't going well"
Malory continued to page through his notes "Your still being
extremely evasive, Lieutenant."
"I have my orders."
"And what do your orders say about answering to Admirals
under direct questioning?"
"I'm willing to pay the price of keeping my orders."
Malory frowned at her stubbornness, this wasn't getting any
where.He knew that she was hiding a lot, but was she sincere
about the secrecy.If she was telling the truth and Star Fleet
was involved, then he shouldn't be asking her questions.
"I'll leave the rest of the questions to the Admiral, maybe
you'll be able to talk more freely with him."Malory said then
turned off his console.
"I don't think so." Whitecloud said matter of factly.
"Well, we'll find out very soon."
The conversation was interrupted by the comm pipping on
"Captain, Bridge here".
"Go ahead, Mr Penthrach"
"Sir, preparing to drop out of warp for approach to Star
Base 89."
"Very good, I'll be there in a few minutes."
"Bridge out."
Malory left the room then the two large security men came in
to escort Whitecloud back to her quarters.As they walked down
the corridor, Anndrea considered her new gaurds.It was obvious
these two were chosen to guard her because of their size.They
even wore security vests that would help protect them incase of
a fight.She was quite flattered by the respect they were
finally showing her.
She decided to start a polite converstation, she looked up
at one, smiled and said sweetly "Are you, afraid of me?"
He looked at her with a frown and replied curtly "No."They
were not suppose to talk to her, and didn't want to.
The tio had arrived at Whitecloud's quarters.She stepped
in, then turned to face them, continuing to smile and holding
her hands behind her back in a loose at-ease posture.
"You should be." she said.
The door slid shut between them.

-----------

The Vigilante had taken up a place off of Star Base 89.
They had been hiding in a nearby system until they estimated the
Delphi would arrive.
The ship's orientation made the Star Base appear to be
laying on it's side.It was a massive structure, designed to
dock more then ten Star Ships at a time.
The top half was dome shape, with a long pylon like tale
extending below it.The structure ended up looking very much
like a mushroom.Protruding from every surface of the Base
where a multitude of antennas and sensor arrays.Evenly spaced
around the base of the dome were five large doors to allow
StarShips into Dry dock.
Being a monitoring station for the neutral zone, Star Base
89 was heavily armed and shielded.It not only had phaser rings
on the dome but had a multitude of phaser cannons and torpedo
launchers spread over the surface.The shield generators were
not as visible but were still there.From shear size alone the
base was able to generate shields capable of with standing a
prolonged attack.
"Ensign, monitor the scanners closely, we don't need anybody
bumping into us."Tarva said from the Captain's chair.Tarva
smiled at her use of words, she was begining to sound like the
Captain.
"Aye, Sir" replied O'Malley.She soon spoke again "Sir, the
Delphi is dropping out of warp and approaching standard orbit
around Star Base 89."
Tarva stood and pressed a button on the Captain's console
"Bridge to Captain Anthony."
"Go ahead." returned the Captain immediately.
"Sir, the Delphi has just dropped out of warp and is
approaching Star Base."
"Acknowledged, I'm on my way."
Tarva then headed to the turbo-lift.

Tarva entered Transporter Room II dressed in her yellow Star
Fleet uniform.Commander Norton, Commander Assali and Chief
Swanson waited for her.Norton also wore his yellow standard
uniform, just incase.
Tarva spoke to Norton as she entered "Have you been able to
spot any of our people on the Delphi?"
"We think we've spotted Valerta and Galleran.We also feel
that we can transport through their shields.As they stand,
their at minimum power and we've been able to determine the
pulse frequency.I think, however, that it wouldn't be prudent
to just pull them out."
"Agreed, what's the Delphi's Transporter activity been
like?"
"There's been some activity but there hasn't been any way to
tell if any of our crew but Valerta and Galleran are still on
the ship." Swanson replied.
Tarva said "I'll go to Star Base and try to contact Captain
Malory from there."
She then stepped onto the front of the large pad.As she
stepped up, she noticed the pad had a slightly different tint to
it then the rest.It was the pad destroyed by the accident that
killed Ensign Shertz.Tarva was tempted to step to an adjoining
pad, but didn't."When ever your ready, Chief."
"Waiting for an opening, Sir" Swanson said as she watched
her scanner. "Energizing"
The scene around Tarva shifted and was replaced by a hallway
on Star Base 89.She immediately started walking as if she was
going somewhere.It would take her a moment or two to get her
bearings but she didn't want to look out of place.
Tarva had been to Star Base 89 and knew where she was going.
The Base lounge was quite large to accommodate the high Star
Base traffic.One feature, was a communication facility for
personnel to make personal calls to other ships.Normally, even
personal traffic had to be channeled through official channels.
These facilities allowed personnel to keep in touch on a more
unofficial level.
"Commander Tarva?" The male voice came from behind her as
she approached the doors to the lounge.When she turned she saw
a medium built human wearing a yellow uniform with Star Base
security insignia.
"Lieutenant Bloom," Tarva said trying to be casual. "It's
been a long time."
"Commander, I didn't know you were visiting, I would have
looked you up."Bloom said with a smile as he approached."How
have you been?"
Lieutenant Ian Bloom had served as second in command of
security under Tarva on the Eclipse.He had transferred to a
position on Star Base A107 a month before the Borg incident.
"I didn't know you were stationed here." Tarva said with a
smile when he reached her.
"I'm Chief of Internal Security." he said proudly.She knew
that his interests always were in Star Base Security."Where
are you stationed now, Sir?"
"I've been working as a security consultant for new
operations in the sector." Tarva lied.
"So your just visiting?Perhaps you'd join me for dinner
this evening, we have so much to catch up on."
Tarva smiled, she and Lieutenant Bloom had become good
friends.She really would like to catch up with him. "I'm
Sorry, I can't, I have somebody else I really do need to catch
before one of us leaves."
"Perhaps I could help." he offered as they approached the
doors to the lounge.
"Thanks, but that's not necessary, all I have to do is make
a call."
He smiled, "Of course, your here to use the comm center.
Okay, I'll let you go."
"Perhaps we can schedule dinner before I leave, I'll contact
you."
"Very good," he said "Till then.." he bowed slightly then
turned crisply and walked back down the hall.
Tarva walked through the nearly empty lounge.Because of
the few patrons she could catch snippets of conversation.Once
again her K.D.F. back ground showed it self.She caught her
self trying to listen to them as she passed.You never know
what you could pick up.
One conversation caught her attention but she didn't allow
herself to even slow down as she passed.
"..I still can't believe the away team was killed, it
happened so quick, no warning."
"And your saying that the Captain is cajoling the person who
caused it?"
"You wouldn't believe..."
Tarva entered one of the comm booths on the far side of the
lounge.She placed her palm on the ID pad, hoping Anthony was
right about how she was officially listed.A small screen lit
up showing her ID information.

NAME: Sashon Tarva
RANK: Commander
POSITION: Security Specialist --
Star Fleet Security Consultant Corps.
NOTES: Currently on Assignment along Romulan
Neutral Zone assessing possible security
Lapses.

Most of the Vigilante's crew where listed as deceased.The
top brass of Project Fulton, however, knew that the Vig may have
need of making some kind of contact with regular Star Fleet.
Some selected officers on the Vigilante were assigned to the
S.F.S.C.C. which was, in fact, just a cover for Project Fulton
personnel.
She then entered her request for a patch to the Delphi.
Since it was a public channel there was a slight wait before the
hail was answered.
The chubby face of a rather over weight man appeared on the
monitor."This is the Delphi, Lieutenant Penthrach, can I help
you?"
"Yes, I'd like to speak with Captain Malory."
The man glanced at his screen obviously checking her
personal information provided with the transmission."I'm
sorry, Commander Tarva, the Captain is not available at this
time.Can I take a message or arrange a call back?"
"Yes, tell the Captain I'd like to speak with him as soon as
he is available."Tarva then placed her communicator pin in a
matching indentation on her console."Entering communicator
frequency now."
"Very good, Commander, I'll pass your message to the Captain
as soon as he is available."
"Thank you, Tarva out."
The screen blinked off, Tarva stood and headed to a table in
the lounge.She was trying to place her pin on properly when a
shadow covered her.Thinking it was the waiter she looked up to
order.
"Commander Tarva?" said a blond haired human female standing
over her.She wore the red uniform of Star Fleet command and
commander pips on her collar.

"The Warriors"
(continued)


....
You who find us in this place,
Have pity in your breast;
Let us in our last embrace,
Under earth sun-hallowed rest.
Night's a claw upon my brain:
Oh, to see the sun again!

Robert W. Service



Tarva stood out of courtesy to a fellow Star Fleet Commander
"Yes, do I know you?"
The woman offered her hand and said "My name is Commander
Shelby".
Tarva ignored the gesture and said "Won't you have a seat."
and motioned toward an extra chair at her table.This was not a
good sign, but Tarva figured Commander Shelby may have merely
recognized her.There weren't that many Kalonians in Star
Fleet.
When they were both seated Tarva asked "How may I help you?"
The woman looked at Tarva seriously "Let me get right to
business, I'm what I guess I would call, the local liaison for
the S.F.S.C.C."
Tarva was not expecting this, she knew that the S.F.S.C.C.
was just a front developed by Project Fulton.Commander Shelby
admitting she was in the 'Corps' was telling her that she must
know about the Vigilante.
Tarva didn't say anything she just looked at Shelby as if
waiting for her to finish a sentence.
So she continued "I was alerted to your presence by the
computer when you accessed the comm station.I must admit that
I was not expecting any of the 'Corps' to be stopping by here so
soon."
"Why wouldn't you be expecting me, Commander, Star Base 89
was on my schedule."Tarva replied pleasantly.
"Of course, this isn't the proper place for us to discuss
this matter." Shelby said and stood up "Shall we."
Tarva followed Shelby out of the lounge.She turned to
Tarva "So, how long have you been on Star Base 89?"
"For a while." Tarva replied.
They walked swiftly through the corridors not speaking.
They turned into a small room in a security section.The room
was bare except for a table and several chairs, when the door
closed, it seemed to seal itself.There wasn't even the
obligatory computer console or other computer based accessories.
Shelby took one of the seats and Tarva sat in another.
"So, how can I help you, Commander?" Tarva said.
"Commander, what in the world are you doing here?Project
Fulton issued explicit orders for you not to make contact.Is
your ship in the area?"
"I do not know who you are, or what connection you have with
Project Fulton.If you are involved, you know that I can't
discuss any details with you.So why have you even contacted
me?"
"I've chosen to contact you because you've boarded Star Base
89 without authorization and you are in direct violation of
Fulton directives.I'm trying to determine why you have done
this and if we should be concerned about your progress." Shelby
seemed to be getting slightly anxious.
Tarva decided that this human knew enough about the project
to confide in."During a training session, we experienced a
failure in one of our personnel delivery systems.This failure
caused the loss of quite a few of the team involved.The
remainder of the team was picked up by Captain Malory and the
U.S.S. Delphi before we had a chance to retrieve them ourselves.
At the same time we found it prudent to remove a Delphi landing
party from the site before some wreckage self destructed."
Shelby put the pieces together "So your ship and the Delphi
have effectively exchanged crew members, is that correct?"
"Yes."
"Now your here to contact Captain Malory to try to effect
some sort of exchange."
"Essentially."
Shelby sat back in her chair and looked at Tarva "Is there
anyway I can help?"
"Does this Admiral Hrgon know about project Fulton?" Tarva
asked.
"Not officially." Shelby said as if it was a running
problem.
"What does that mean?"
"The Admiral is, shall we say, extremely nosy, he has to
know everything that is going on in his quadrant.He won't
acknowledge the fact that there may be some Star Fleet projects
that he shouldn't know about."
Tarva thought for a second then asked "And how much do you
know of the project, just were are you placed?"
"You may have already guessed that I can't really answer
that question but I can tell you what I don't know.I don't
know your ship's name or how its going to do what its suppose
to.I don't know the Captain, it could be you. I do know some
of the basic tech theories proposed for use in Project Fulton
but I don't know their standing.I guess my job is that of
liaison, any time S.F.S.C.C. comes through the computer, I jump.
Other then that, I have regular duties here.In fact, this is
the first time I've actually been needed in this capacity."
"I think you may be able to help us, Commander." Tarva said
"If we are going to convince Captain Malory to go along with us
we may need your input."
"That's why I'm here."
Tarva's comm pin began to chime, she immediately touched it
and said "This is Commander Tarva"
"Commander," came a familiar voice "Malory here."
Tarva smiled at the sound of his voice "Captain, I need to
talk to you, it's quite important"
"I can arrange for you to beam over, if you want."
"That would be best." Tarva replied.
"Very good, I'll release authorization."
"Acknowledged, Tarva out."
Tarva turned to Shelby "Where's the nearest transporter
room?"
"I'll take you."
The two commanders walked out of the secure room and headed
down the hall.

-----------

Tarva watched Commander Shelby, the Transporter Chief and
the Star Base transporter room begin to sparkle, soon everything
was sparkling.The sparkling began to reform in the shape of a
new transporter room.At the controls was a Yellow shirtted
operator and next him was a young man in a red command uniform.
As soon as she could move again, Tarva came stiffly to
attention and said "Captain, permission to come aboard, Sir?"
"Permission granted," Captain Malory said "Welcome aboard
the Delphi."
"Thank you, Sir."
"So, Commander Tarva," Malory said with a smile "how have
you been?"The standard offer of a handshake was absent.
"I've been fine." She replied formally "Sir, I do need to
talk with you."
"Yes, of course." Malory said then motioned to the door.
"Won't you come with me."They walked into the hall and headed
to the turbo lift."So, Commander, your doing security
consulting now, must be very interesting."
"Yes, Sir, I get to do a lot of traveling, it keeps me quite
busy."They rode the lift only a few decks before stepping onto
the bridge.
Tarva quickly surveyed the bridge.It was definitely a
standard Pentalia layout but obviously brand new.A few things
looked slightly familiar.They were the extra panels tacked on
to the ops station and science station.Very similar in look to
what was tacked on the Vigilante's helm and navigation stations.
"Mr Qhasmon," Malory said to the blue skinned Andorian
sitting in the Captain's chair "Please make sure that I have
minimum interruptions while I talk to Commander Tarva"
"Aye, Sir." he replied immediately.
Tarva followed Malory into his ready room and as the door
slid shut she heard someone say "Two Kalonian's in less then a
week, that's one for the record book."
As soon as the door closed Malory turned around and embraced
Tarva."Sashon, what are you doing here?" He asked after their
short hug.
"Percival, I've got a problem and I need your help."
"You know I'd do anything I can for you."Malory said as he
leaned against his desk with hands to his side."What do you
need, passage somewhere, someplace to stay, what?"
Tarva frowned slightly and took a step toward him "It's not
that easy."
"Well, lets hear it then." Malory was starting to get
interested, he had never known Sashon to be evasive.
Tarva looked around the room then said "Is this room totally
secured?"
Malory looked puzzled and troubled at the same time then
said "Computer"
"WORKING" came the generic female voice.
"Initiate, Alpha security"
"ALPHA SECURITY INITIATED" Replied the voice.
Tarva looked back at the door control panel.The small
green light on it had changed to red.The red light was the
only out ward sign of a security code implementation.
"Satisfied?" Malory had walked behind his desk and motioned
for Tarva to have a seat.After she sat down, so did he."Now
what's with all of the secrecy?"
Tarva sat back comfortably, crossed her legs at the knees
and said "I'm here to get my crew back."
"And what crew is that?" Malory asked sounding genuinely
confused.
Tarva smiled "I believe you picked them up in AR-24.I'm
here to retrieve them."
"So she wasn't lying when she said Star Fleet was involved."
Malory mused to himself.
"Who is that, Captain?"
Malory sat for a minute then said "I should have known that
you were involved, Whitecloud is too damned cold to be
associated with anybody else."
"I hope the Lieutenant hasn't caused you any trouble, I must
warn you that some would refer to her as, I believe the proper
phrase is 'a Loose Cannon'." Tarva paused then added "Lieutenant
Whitecloud is a very good warrior, she was one of my star pupils
when I was training Special Forces."
Malory smiled, "Thanks for the warning, but it's a bit
late.Don't worry though, no one was injured too severely.."
"I do apologize for any incident that may have occurred.
Most of our crew is a bit 'on the edge'.We've learned how to
deal with them, but they can be a handful if your not prepared."
"So I found out." Malory agreed.
Tarva had to turn the conversation back on track "Now if you
could tell me who else is alive and where they are."
"Now wait a minute, Sashon, three of my officers were killed
in AR-24.I can't just turn them over to you without finishing
the investigation."Something was going on here and Malory
wasn't about to just drop everything blindly, even if the
security of the Federation was involved.He had a duty to his
ship and his crew to find out what.Besides, if this was for
real, Admiral Hrgon would know about it, wouldn't he?
"What I was hoping for is not going to be that easy,
Captain." Tarva said "But that brings me to the other topic I
wanted to discuss."
"And what might that be?"
"Your landing party was not killed at AR-24."
"What?"
"We were able to retrieve them just before the explosion."
"If my people are still alive, where are they?"
"They are quite safe, you can trust me on that.Right now,
they're just waiting for me to arrange a proper exchange."
"Well, that's going to be difficult.Lieutenant Whitecloud
has already been transferred to the Star Base for interrogation.
I was delivering her when you called."Malory seemed quite
aware of the irony.
Tarva considered for a second then said "Can you get her
back?"
Malory laughed "Get her back? I couldn't even keep her
myself!As required, I had to inform the Admiral of the deaths
of my three crewmen.As such, the Admiral wanted all of the
details... After I informed him of the party that I beamed up,
he almost went berserk.He wants to interrogate all of them
personally, I would have liked to have asked my own questions...
I have to deliver the other four survivors within a couple of
hours ..."
"I thought there were six survivors?" Tarva said concerned.
"Oh yes, the Vulcan S'Turlek, did not survive his injuries."
Tarva was quiet for a few moments "Let me lay this on the
table.We have to get this taken care of.Not only do we want
to get both crews back to were they're suppose to be, but we
also need to adjust ship's logs to erase all data collected."
"Now wait a minute, your asking me to forge my logs on your
word?"Malory was quite serious "I'm sorry, Sashon, but I can't
do that, on what little you've given me."
Tarva said"We knew that this would be your response so
we've arranged to give you more then my word."She then stood
and pulled out a large old style communicator from under the
back of her uniform.She flipped it open and said "Have you
made arrangements with Commander Shelby?"
Malory shuddered, if Commander Shelby is involved in this,
it must have something to do with the Borg.If that's true,
it's no wonder they have such tight security.
Tarva listened to the response on the communicator then said
to Malory "Can you at least promise not to make any new logs
concerning this incident and especially this conversation until
I've had further opportunity to convince you?"
Now Malory didn't need to consider for a second "I will not
make any new logs or investigate this incident further until
you've had that chance."
Tarva smiled "Now would be as good a time as any to get
started."
Captain Malory stood, ready for the intrigue."Where do we
go?"
"Let's start by going back to Star Base 89."
"Okay, but first, I have to talk with my officers, won't you
wait on the bridge for a second.Computer, cancel alpha
security."
"ALPHA SECURITY CANCELED."
The red light on the control pad changed back to green and
Tarva headed out.She could hear Malory asking some of his
officers to come in.
The communications officer and a young female officer were
already headed to the ready room as she stepped onto the bridge.

"Mr Penthrach, has there been any unauthorized
communications to or from the Delphi, say in the past ten
minutes?" Malory asked as soon as the door was closed.
The Lieutenant stiffened his large frame "No sir, our
systems would alert us to any unauthorized transmission."
Malory then turned to the female "Ensign, has there been any
unusual ORACLE anomalies since we dropped out of warp?"
The Ensign also came to stiff attention "No Sir, We've been
doing the standard calibrations since arrival.We have not had
any unaccounted for readings."The standard ORACLE testing
procedures included testing it's output against the known
readings from other ships and structures in the area.
"Is there a problem, Sir?" Penthrach asked.
"No Lieutenant, dismissed."
With that all three stepped onto the bridge.

Tarva and Malory appeared in a small transporter room on
Star Base 89.The room was empty except for the operator, a
blond haired human female wearing a red command uniform.
"Commander Shelby, how nice to see you again."Malory said
to the attractive officer as soon as he was released from the
effects of the transporter.
Shelby was all business "Sir, won't you come with me
please?"She immediately turned and exited the room before they
had a chance to even step down from the transporter.
Tarva and Malory followed Commander Shelby, none of them
said a word.They were soon in the security section standing
outside the secure room Tarva and Shelby had met in earlier.
The door opened indicating it was unoccupied.Shelby pressed a
button on the control pad closing it in front of them.Tarva
and Shelby watched down the corridor until it was empty.Shelby
then nodded to Tarva.
Tarva pulled out her communicator and said into it "All is
clear, you may proceed when ready."the communicator was
quickly returned to it's place under her tunic.
A light blinked on the control pad indicating the door was
being operated from inside.It then slid open revealing
Malory's First Officer.
"Captain, it's good to see you again." Assali said with a
wide smile.

The four sat around the table in the sealed room.Tarva,
Shelby and Assali had been laying out the details of what needed
to be done.With Assali convinced it hadn't taken much to swing
Malory.There came a time that every Captain had to implicitly
trust his officers especially the First Officer this was
certainly one of them.
"I still can't believe that Admiral Hrgon is out side the
loop on this." Malory said.
"We couldn't include everybody." Shelby replied "That would
defeat the purpose.The more people who know, the greater the
chance of a leak either accidental or intentional we just can't
afford one.Besides, though Admiral Hrgon's loyalty to Star
Fleet is indisputable, he does have his own agenda.We don't
need anybody side tracking Project Fulton to affect their own
power base."
"I suppose your right, but it still disturbs me to be going
around a commanding officer's back."Malory thought for a
second then said "How about Commodore Albrit?"
Shelby frowned, "He's dead, we're still not sure what
happened to him.No disrespect intended, but I wouldn't have
had anything to do with this project if he'd been involved."
Malory frowned and nodded as well, "I hadn't heard that ...
but you've won me over... Now, how are we going to accomplish
this task?"

After further discussion they had come up with plans to get
The Vigilante's crew back to her and they had a plan for
explaining the reappearance of the Delphi's officers.The
biggest problem would be getting Whitecloud away from Admiral
Hrgon without him going ballistic looking for her.That was the
tough part, he had her under tight guard and would be ready for
the others very soon.
After they stood to leave Assali pulled out an over sized
communicator, like Tarva carried.He watched the others leave
as he signaled the Vigilante.As soon as the door shut behind
them the walls shifted and became the Vigilante's transporter
room.

Malory spoke to Commander Shelby as they walked back toward
the transporter room."Tarva and I will begin preparations as
soon as we get back to the Delphi."
"Very good, I'll begin preparations on this end.I hope all
works out, we need to get this over with as soon as possible."
Shelby had just finished speaking when they turned a corner and
came face to face with Admiral Hrgon and Lieutenant Bloom.


"Ah, Captain Malory, just the human I've been looking for."
said the Admiral.He was relatively short, a Tellerite, quite
hairy with a large nose, more like a snout.
Malory, Shelby and Tarva immediately came to a natural
attention."Sir," Malory said "How can I help you?"
Hrgon ignored Malory for the moment and turned to
acknowledge the others "Commander Shelby, and this must be
Commander Tarva."
"Sir" they both said.
"Commander Tarva, your with the S F S C C?" Hrgon pronounced
each of the letters as if it were a word.
"Yes, Sir." She replied.
"Very good, I'll be wanting to discuss something with you,
if you could contact my aid to set up a time."
"Sir, I may not be in the area much longer." Tarva said
trying to avoid the meeting.
"Well, we'll just have to make it soon.By the way,
Lieutenant Bloom informs me he could not find a record of your
billet assignment or even of your arrival itinerary."
"Sir," Tarva said not wanting to appear defensive "part of
my job is to identify security lapses at Star Fleet
installations.Though I'm not here on official business it's
become kind of standard for us to travel under low profile.
Since I'd just arrived, when I encountered Lieutenant Bloom, I
had not yet secured quarters.Now Captain Malory has offered
the hospitality of the Delphi so I'll be billeting there."
"And what of Lieutenant Whitecloud?" Malory asked.
Hrgon looked at the two female security specialists flanking
the Captain then said "We were unable to get any new information
from her.She has been extremely well trained, I wish my whole
security staff were trained as professionally."The last remark
made Bloom shift uneasily.
"Also, Captain" Hrgon continued "I'm going to want to
discuss this matter with you more in depth some time soon, as
well as your new orders, now that Albrit is dead.Perhaps you
should accompany the rest of Whitecloud's crew when
you transport them over."
"Yes, perhaps that would be the best time." Malory agreed,
somewhat surprised by Hrgon's callousness.
"Very good." Hrgon was about to walk away when he turned to
Shelby."Commander, are you available in about half an hour?
I've got some problems related to Captain Malory's guests I'd
like your opinion on."
"Yes, Sir." Shelby said instinctively.
"That will be all, dismissed." Hrgon and Bloom continued
down the corridor.
"Do you think he just happened to bump into us?" Tarva said
more insinuating than asking.
Nobody bothered answering her, they were at the transporter
room.

-----------

Tarva stood in her room on the Delphi looking out at Star
Base 89.She had to take her room for appearances sake but they
had work to do.She had her communicator in hand but she had
paused to look at the majesty of the station.
Tarva flipped open the devise, held it up to the side of her
face and said one word "Energize".
There was a slight pause waiting for an opening then the
wall and window in front of her shifted and became Transporter
Room II on the Vigilante.Captain Anthony stood next to Chief
Swanson at the controls, with him were Commanders Assali and
Norton."Report" he said simply.
"Sir, as Commander Assali has probably reported we have a
plan to return all crew to their proper assignments.There will
be a slight delay retrieving Lieutenant Whitecloud, she has
already been transferred to Star Base 89."Tarva remained
standing on the transporter."The only other problem will be
telling exactly when our team is being transported."
"Does the Delphi have any Klingon or Kalonian crew?"
Anthony asked.He had approached her and stood a step below her
so he could talk to her more face to face.
Tarva knew where he was leading "No sir, the Klingon and the
Kalonian our scans show are both survivors of the drop ship."
"And there are five of our people still on the Delphi?"
"No Sir, one of the original crew died after arriving on the
Delphi.He was the Vulcan S'Turlek."Tarva had not moved from
her spot.
"So as long as they transport all of our crew at the same
time, by themselves, we should be able to get them back."
Anthony headed back to his place by the control panel.
"Sir, Captain Malory has assured us he would arrange to make
it so." Assali said.
"Very good," Anthony turned back to Tarva "Commander, you'd
better get back to the Delphi."
"Aye, Sir."
The wall and window shifted back.

-----------


"Sir, Holding Area R-8 reports they are prepared to receive
our guests."reported the Yeoman standing at the control panel.
"Very well, have them brought in."Malory and Tarva stood
to one side of the operator.They would beam over after
transporting the four.
The door to the transporter room opened to allow in the new
arrivals.First in was the Klingon female flanked by two
security guards.The rest followed, each accompanied by two
security guards with drawn weapons.One of the guards carried a
metal satchel that contained all of the equipment and clothing
the survivors had with them when they came aboard.The last in
was the Chief of security, her and the guard carrying the bag
were the only ones without drawn phasers.
The four walked straight to the transporter and took their
positions.None of them said a word or acknowledged Tarva's
presence, but they did notice her.The bag was placed on its
own pad then the security stood back from the pad, as was
custom.They, however, did keep their weapons drawn.
Malory turned to the operator "Raise force field".
"Force field activated." he said after pushing a few
buttons.
The security immediately holstered their weapons.
"Dismissed." Lieutenant Zalvasta said.The eight immediately
filed out of the room.
Malory, Tarva, Zalvosta and the operator were the only ones
to remain.
"Where is Smith," The Klingon demanded.
"What have you done with her?" said one of the humans.
Malory smiled, they were good, defiant to the end."Don't
worry, you should be seeing her very soon."he then turned to
the operator "Energize."
A few buttons were pushed, then he slid his fingers up the
control panels applying power.The four started the normal
sparkling then the operator said "Sir, I'm reading some sort of
power surge.Delphi to R-8, do you have a lock?"
They had started fading in and out "Delphi, this is R-8 we
can't get a secure lock, increasing power."
The operator responded "Try to reverse, we don't want to
lose them."
"Acknowledged." the four continued to sparkle and fade.
"What's going on?" Malory demanded.
"Sir, something's wrong, we've lost the fix, trying to
regain now."The operator was desperately pushing buttons.A
red light on the console began to blink accompanied by a beeping
sound.
"Delphi, do you have them?" came a worried voice over the
speaker.
"I think I've got the lock..." the whole transporter flashed
from an explosion.The force field absorbed most of the
explosion but failed from loss of energy.The control panel
mostly protected the operator but Zalvosta, Malory and Tarva
were fully exposed.All three were thrown back against the bulk
head.
Red emergency lights came on to a loud fire claxon.The
operator stood up from his instinctive ducking position and
started calling for medical and emergency teams.He then turned
to attend his Captain.
"Delphi, what happened over there, we've totally lost them.
Do you have them?Delphi, please come in...."

-----------

Tarva limped into Malory's quarters after signaling.A
fresh scar ran down the far right of her face from just below
her ear wrapping around toward front of her neck and
disappearing under her collar near the rank pips.Her left arm
hung in a low sling.
Malory sat at a work station table in the middle section of
his suite.A large regeneration patch was affixed to the right
side of his face.
As she approached, he looked up at her.She could see the
fury in his eyes."Computer!"
"WORKING"
"Initiate Alpha Security."he said loudly.
"ALPHA SECURITY INITIATED."
Malory stood up to face Tarva she could see his upper torso
was held stiff by a temporary brace.
"What the HELL did you people do to My transporter?!" He was
losing his attempts to control the anger."We could've all been
killed!"
"Sir," Tarva said trying not to react to his emotions "the

GULLIVER'S TRAVELS

LETTER_TO_SYMPSON
A LETTER FROM CAPTAIN GULLIVER TO HIS COUSIN SYMPSON
-
I hope you will be ready to own publicly, whenever you shall be
called to it, that by your great and frequent urgency you prevailed on
me to publish a very loose and uncorrect account of my travels; with
direction to hire some young gentlemen of either university to put
them in order, and correct the style, as my cousin Dampier did by my
advice, in his book called A Voyage round the World. But I do not
remember I gave you power to consent that any thing should be omitted,
and much less that any thing should be inserted: therefore, as to
the latter, I do here renounce every thing of that kind;
particularly a paragraph about her Majesty the late Queen Anne, of
most pious and glorious memory; although I did reverence and esteem
her more than any of human species. But you, or your interpolator,
ought to have considered, that as it was not my inclination, so was it
not decent to praise any animal of our composition before my master
Houyhnhnm: and besides the fact was altogether false; for to my
knowledge, being in England during some part of her Majesty's reign,
she did govern by a chief minister; nay, even by two successively; the
first whereof was the Lord of Godolphin, and the second the Lord of
Oxford; so that you have made me say the thing that was not. Likewise,
in the account of the Academy of Projectors, and several passages of
my discourse to my master Houyhnhnm, you have either omitted some
material circumstances, or minced or changed them in such a manner,
that I do hardly know my own work. When I formerly hinted to you
something of this in a letter, you were pleased to answer that you
were afraid of giving offense; that people in power were very watchful
over the press, and apt not only to interpret, but to punish every
thing which looked like an innuendo (as I think you called it). But
pray, how could that which I spoke so many years ago, and at about
five thousand leagues distance, in another reign, be applied to any of
the Yahoos who now are said to govern the herd; especially at a time
when I little thought on or feared the unhappiness of living under
them? Have not I the most reason to complain, when I see these very
Yahoos carried by Houyhnhnms in a vehicle, as if these were brutes,
and those the rational creatures? And indeed, to avoid so monstrous
and detestable a sight was one principal motive of my retirement
hither.
Thus much I thought proper to tell you in relation to yourself,
and to the trust I reposed in you.
I do in the next place complain of my own great want of judgement,
in being prevailed upon by the entreaties and false reasonings of
you and some others, very much against my own opinion, to suffer my
travels to be published. Pray bring to your mind how often I desired
you to consider, when you insisted on the motive of public good;
that the Yahoos were a species of animals utterly incapable of
amendment by precepts or examples: and so it hath proved; for
instead of seeing a full stop put to all abuses and corruptions, at
least in this little island, as I had reason to expect: behold,
after above six months warning, I cannot learn that my book hath
produced one single effect according to my intentions: I desired you
would let me know by a letter, when party and faction were
extinguished; judges learned and upright; pleaders honest and
modest, with some tincture of common sense; and Smithfield blazing
with pyramids of lawbooks; the young nobility's education entirely
changed; the physicians banished; the female Yahoos abounding in
virtue, honour, truth and good sense; courts and levees of great
ministers thoroughly weeded and swept; wit, merit and learning
rewarded; all disgracers of the press in prose and verse condemned
to eat nothing but their own cotton, and quench their thirst with
their own ink. These and a thousand other reformations, I firmly
counted upon by your encouragement; as indeed they were plainly
deducible from the precepts delivered in my book. And it must be owned
that seven months were a sufficient time to correct every vice and
folly to which Yahoos are subject, if their natures had been capable
of the least disposition to virtue or wisdom: yet so far have you been
from answering my expectation in any of your letters, that on the
contrary you are loading our carrier every week with libels, and keys,
and reflections, and memoirs, and second parts; wherein I see myself
accused of reflecting upon great states-folk, of degrading human
nature (for so they have still the confidence to style it), and of
abusing the female sex. I find likewise that the writers of those
bundles are not agreed among themselves; for some of them will not
allow me to be author of my own travels; and others make me author
of books to which I am wholly a stranger.
I find likewise that your printer hath been so careless as to
confound the times, and mistake the dates of my several voyages and
returns; neither assigning the true year, or the true month, or day of
the month: and I hear the original manuscript is all destroyed since
the publication of my book. Neither have I any copy left: however I
have sent you some corrections, which you may insert, if ever there
should be a second edition: and yet I cannot stand to them, but
shall leave that matter to my judicious and candid readers, to
adjust it as they please.
I hear some of our sea-Yahoos find fault with my sea-language, as
not proper in many parts, nor now in use. I cannot help it. In my
first voyages, while I was young, I was instructed by the oldest
mariners, and learned to speak as they did. But I have since found
that the sea-Yahoos are apt, like the land ones, to become new-fangled
in their words, which the latter change every year, insomuch as I
remember upon each return to my own country their old dialect was so
altered that I could hardly understand the new. And I observe, when
any Yahoo comes from London out of curiosity visit me at my own house,
we neither of us are able to deliver our conceptions in a manner
intelligible to the other.
{LETTER_TO_SYMPSON ^paragraph 5}
If the censure of Yahoos could any way affect me, I should have
great reason to complain that some of them are so bold as to think
my book of travels a mere fiction out of my own brain, and have gone
so far as to drop hints that the Houyhnhnms and Yahoos have no more
existence than the inhabitants of Utopia.
Indeed I must confess, that as to the people of Lilliput,
Brobdingrag (for so the word should have been spelt, and not
erroneously Brobdingnag), and Laputa, I have never yet heard of any
Yahoo so presumptuous as to dispute their being, or the facts I have
related concerning them; because the truth immediately strikes every
reader with conviction. And is there less probability in my account of
the Houyhnhnms or Yahoos, when it is manifest as to the latter,
there are so many thousands even in this city, who only differ from
their brother brutes in Houyhnhnm-land, because they use a sort of a
jabber, and do not go naked? I wrote for their amendment, and not
their approbation. The united praise of the whole race would be of
less consequence to me than the neighing of those two degenerate
Houyhnhnms I keep in my stable; because from these, degenerate as they
are, I still improve in some virtues, without any mixture of vice.
Do these miserable animals presume to think that I am so far
degenerated as to defend my veracity? Yahoo as I am, it is well
known through all Houyhnhnm-land, that by the instructions and example
of my illustrious master I was able in the compass of two years
(although I confess with the utmost difficulty) to remove that
infernal habit of lying, shuffling, deceiving, and equivocating, so
deeply rooted in the very souls of all my species, especially the
Europeans.
I have other complaints to make upon this vexatious occasion; but
I forbear troubling myself or you any further. I must freely
confess, that since my last return some corruptions of my Yahoo nature
have revived in me by conversing with a few of your species, and
particularly those of my own family, by an unavoidable necessity; else
I should never have attempted so absurd a project as that of reforming
the Yahoo race in this kingdom; but I have now done with all visionary
schemes for ever.

PUBLISHERS_LETTER
THE PUBLISHER TO THE READER
-
The author of these Travels, Mr. Lemuel Gulliver, is my ancient
and intimate friend; there is likewise some relation between us by the
mother's side. About three years ago Mr. Gulliver, growing weary of
the concourse of curious people coming to him at his house in Redriff,
made a small purchase of land, with a convenient house, near Newark in
Nottinghamshire, his native country; where he now lives retired, yet
in good esteem among his neighbors.
Although Mr. Gulliver was born in Nottinghamshire, where his
father dwelt, yet I have heard him say his family came from
Oxfordshire; to confirm which, I have observed in the churchyard at
Banbury, in that county, several tombs and monuments of the Gullivers.
Before he quitted Redriff, he left the custody of the following
papers in my hands, with the liberty to dispose of them as I should
think fit. I have carefully perused them three times: the style is
very plain and simple; and the only fault I find is, that the
author, after the manner of travelers, is a little too circumstantial.
There is an air of truth apparent through the whole; and indeed the
author was so distinguished for his veracity, that it became a sort of
proverb among his neighbors at Redriff, when any one affirmed a thing,
to say it was as true as if Mr. Gulliver had spoke it.
By the advice of several worthy persons, to whom, with the
author's permission, I communicated these papers, I now venture to
send them into the world, hoping they may be at least, for some
time, a better entertainment to our young noblemen than the common
scribbles of politics and party.
This volume would have been at least twice as large, if I had not
made bold to strike out innumerable passages relating to the winds and
tides, as well as to the variations and bearings in the several
voyages; together with the minute descriptions of the management of
the ship in storms, in the style of sailors: likewise the account of
the longitudes and latitudes; wherein I have reason to apprehend
that Mr. Gulliver may be a little dissatisfied: but I was resolved
to fit the work as much as possible to the general capacity of
readers. However, if my own ignorance in sea-affairs shall have led me
to commit some mistakes, I alone am answerable for them: and if any
traveler hath a curiosity to see the whole work at large, as it came
from the hand of the author, I shall be ready to gratify him.
{PUBLISHERS_LETTER ^paragraph 5}
As for any further particulars relating to the author, the reader
will receive satisfaction from the first pages of the book.

CHAPTER I
-
My father had a small estate in Nottinghamshire; I was the third
of five sons. He sent me to Emanuel College in Cambridge at fourteen
years old, where I resided three years, and applied myself close to my
studies: but the charge of maintaining me (although I had a very
scanty allowance) being too great for a narrow fortune, I was bound
apprentice to Mr. James Bates, an eminent surgeon in London, with whom
I continued four years; and my father now and then sending me small
sums of money, I laid them out in learning navigation, and other parts
of the mathematics, useful to those who intend to travel, as I
always believed it would be some time or other my fortune to do.
When I left Mr. Bates, I went down to my father; where, by the
assistance of him and my uncle John, and some other relations, I got
forty pounds, and a promise of thirty pounds a year to maintain me
at Leyden: there I studied physic two years and seven months,
knowing it would be useful in long voyages.
Soon after my return from Leyden, I was recommended, by my good
master Mr. Bates, to be surgeon to the Swallow, Captain Abraham
Pannell commander; with whom I continued three years and a half,
making a voyage or two into the Levant, and some other parts. When I
came back, I resolved to settle in London, to which Mr. Bates, my
master, encouraged me, and by him I was recommended to several
patients. I took part of a small house in the Old Jury; and being
advised to alter my condition, I married Mrs. Mary Burton, second
daughter to Mr. Edmund Burton, hosier, in Newgate-street, with whom
I received four hundred pounds for a portion.
But, my good master Bates dying in two years after, and I having few
friends, my business began to fail; for my conscience would not suffer
me to imitate the bad practice of too many among my brethren. Having
therefore consulted with my wife, and some of my acquaintance, I
determined to go again to sea. I was surgeon successively in two
ships, and made several voyages, for six years, to the East and West
Indies, by which I got some addition to my fortune. My hours of
leisure I spent in reading the best authors, ancient and modern, being
always provided with a good number of books; and when I was ashore, in
observing the manners and dispositions of the people, well as learning
their language, wherein I had a great facility by the strength of my
memory.
The last of these voyages not proving very fortunate, I grew weary
of the sea, and intended to stay at home with my wife and family. I
removed from the Old jury to Fetter-Lane, and from thence to Wapping
hoping to get business among the sailors; but it would not turn to
account. After three years expectation that things would mend, I
accepted an advantageous offer from Captain William Prichard, master
of the Antelope, who was making a voyage to the South-Sea. We set sail
from Bristol May 4, 1699, and our voyage at first was very prosperous.
It would not be proper, for some reasons, to trouble the reader with
the particulars of our adventures in those seas: let it suffice to
inform him, that in our passage from thence to the East Indies, we
were driven by a violent storm to the northwest of Van Diemen's
Land. By an observation, we found ourselves in the latitude of 30
degrees 2 minutes south. Twelve of our crew were dead by immoderate
labor and ill food, the rest were in a very weak condition. On the
fifth of November, which was the beginning of summer in those parts,
the weather being very hazy, the seamen spied a rock, within half a
cable's length of the ship; but the wind was so strong, that we were
driven directly upon it, and immediately split. Six of the crew, of
whom I was one, having let down the boat into the sea, made a shift to
get clear of the ship, and the rock. We rowed by my computation
about three leagues, till we were able to work no longer, being
already spent with labor while we were in the ship. We therefore
trusted ourselves to the mercy of the waves, and in about half an hour
the boat was overset by a sudden flurry from the north. What became of
my companions in the boat, as well as of those who escaped on the
rock, or were left in the vessel, I cannot tell; but conclude they
were all lost. For my own part, I swam as fortune directed me, and was
pushed forward by wind and tide. I often let my legs drop, and could
feel no bottom: but when I was almost gone, and able to struggle no
longer, I found myself within my depth; and by this time the storm was
much abated. The declivity was so small, that I walked near a mile
before I got to the shore, which I conjectured was about eight o'clock
in the evening. I then advanced forward near half a mile, but could
not discover any sign of houses or inhabitants; at least I was in so
weak a condition, that I did not observe them. I was extremely
tired, and with that, and the heat of the weather, and about half a
pint of brandy that I drank as I left the ship, I found myself much
inclined to sleep. I lay down on the grass, which was very short and
soft, where I slept sounder than ever I remember to have done in my
life, and, as I reckoned, above nine hours; for when I awakened, it
was just daylight. I attempted to rise, but was not able to stir
for, as I happened to he on my back, I found my arms and legs were
strongly fastened on each side to the ground; and my hair, which was
long and thick, tied down in the same manner. I likewise felt
several slender ligatures across my body, from my armpits to my
thighs. I could only look upwards; the sun began to grow hot, and
the light offended my eyes. I heard a confused noise about me, but
in the posture I lay, could see nothing except the sky. In a little
time I felt something alive moving on my left leg, which advancing
gently forward over my breast, came almost up to my chin; when bending
my eyes downwards as much as I could, I perceived it to be a human
creature not six inches high, with a bow and arrow in his hands, and a
quiver at his back. In the meantime, I felt at least forty more of the
same kind (as I conjectured) following the first. I was in the
utmost astonishment, and roared so loud, that they all ran back in a
fright; and some of them, as I was afterwards told, were hurt with the
falls they got by leaping from my sides upon the ground. However, they
soon returned, and one of them, who ventured so far as to get a full
sight of my face, lifting up his hands and eyes by way of
admiration, cried out in a shrill but distinct voice, Hekinah degul:
the others repeated the same words several times, but I then knew
not what they meant. I lay all this while, as the reader may
believe, in great uneasiness: at length, struggling to get loose, I
had the fortune to break the strings, and wrench out the pegs that
fastened my left arm to the ground; for, by lifting it up to my
face, I discovered the methods they had taken to bind me, and at the
same time, with a violent pull, which gave me excessive pain, I a
little loosened the strings that tied down my hair on the left side,
so that I was just able to turn my head about two inches. But the
creatures ran off a second time, before I could seize them;
whereupon there was a great shout in a very shrill accent, and after
it ceased, I heard one of them cry aloud, Tolgo phonac; when in an
instant I felt above a hundred arrows discharged on my left hand,
which pricked me like so many needles; and besides they shot another
flight into the air, as we do bombs in Europe, whereof many, I
suppose, fell on my body (though I felt them not) and some on my face,
which I immediately covered with my left hand. When this shower of
arrows was over, I fell a groaning with grief and pain, and then
striving again to get loose, they discharged another volley larger
than the first, and some of them attempted with spears to stick me
in the sides; but, by good luck, I had on me a buff jerkin, which they
could not pierce. I thought it the most prudent method to lie still,
and my design was to continue so till night, when, my left hand
being already loose, I could easily free myself: and as for the
inhabitants, I had reason to believe I might be a match for the
greatest armies they could bring against me, if they were all of the
same size with him that I saw. But fortune disposed otherwise of me.
When the people observed I was quiet, they discharged no more
arrows; but, by the noise I heard, I knew their numbers increased; and
about four yards from me, over against my right ear, I heard a
knocking for above an hour, like that of people at work; when
turning my head that way, as well as the pegs and strings would permit
me, I saw a stage erected, about a foot and a half from the ground,
capable of holding four of the inhabitants, with two or three
ladders to mount it: from whence one of them, who seemed to be a
person of quality, made me a long speech, whereof I understood not one
syllable. But I should have mentioned, that before the principal
person began his oration, he cried out three times, Langro dehul san
(these words and the former were afterwards repeated and explained
to me). Whereupon immediately about fifty of the inhabitants came, and
cut the strings that fastened the left side of my head, which gave
me the liberty of turning it to the right, and of observing the person
and gesture of him that was to speak. He appeared to be of a middle
age, and taller than any of the other three who attended him,
whereof one was a page that held up his train, and seemed to be
somewhat longer than my middle finger; the other two stood one on each
side to support him. He acted every part of an orator, and I could
observe many periods of threatenings, and others of promises, pity,
and kindness. I answered in a few words, but in the most submissive
manner, lifting up my left hand and both my eyes to the sun, as
calling him for a witness; and being almost famished with hunger,
having not eaten a morsel for some hours before I left the ship, I
found the demands of nature so strong upon me, that I could not
forbear showing my impatience (perhaps against the strict rules of
decency) by putting my finger frequently on my mouth, to signify
that I wanted food. The Hurgo (for so they call a great lord, as I
afterwards learned) understood me very well. He descended from the
stage, and commanded that several ladders should be applied to my
sides, on which above a hundred of the inhabitants mounted, and walked
towards my mouth, laden with baskets full of meat, which had been
provided, and sent thither by the King's orders, upon the first
intelligence he received of me. I observed there was the flesh of
several animals, but could not distinguish them by the taste. There
were shoulders, legs, and loins, shaped like those of mutton, and very
well dressed, but smaller than the wings of a lark. I ate them by
two or three at a mouthful, and took three loaves at a time, about the
bigness of musket bullets. They supplied me as they could, showing a
thousand marks of wonder and astonishment at my bulk and appetite. I
then made another sign that I wanted drink. They found by my eating
that a small quantity would not suffice me, and being a most ingenious
people, they slung up with great dexterity one of their largest
hogsheads, then rolled it toward my hand, and beat out the top; I
drank it off at a draught, which I might well do, for it did not
hold half a pint, and tasted like a small wine of Burgundy, but much
more delicious. They brought me a second hogshead, which I drank in
the same manner, and made signs for more, but they had none to give
me. When I had performed these wonders, they shouted for joy, and
danced upon my breast, repeating several times as they did at first,
Hekinah degul. They made me a sign that I should throw down the two
hogsheads, but first warning the people below to stand out of the way,
crying aloud, Borach mivola, and when they saw the vessels in the air,
there was a universal shout of Hekinah degul. I confess I was often
tempted, while they were passing backwards and forwards on my body, to
seize forty or fifty of the first that came in my reach, and dash them
against the ground. But the remembrance of what I had felt, which
probably might not be the worst they could do, and the promise of
honor I made them, for so I interpreted my submissive behavior, soon
drove out these imaginations. Besides, I now considered myself as
bound by the laws of hospitality to a people who had treated me with
so much expense and magnificence. However, in my thoughts I could
not sufficiently wonder at the intrepidity of these diminutive
mortals, who dare venture to mount and walk upon my body, while one of
my hands was at liberty, without trembling at the very sight of so
prodigious a creature as I must appear to them. After some time,
when they observed that I made no more demands for meat, there
appeared before me a person of high rank from his Imperial Majesty.
His Excellency, having mounted on the small of my right leg,
advanced forwards up to my face, with about a dozen of his retinue.
And producing his credentials under the Signet Royal, which he applied
close to my eyes, spoke about ten minutes, without any signs of anger,
but with a kind of determinate resolution; often pointing forwards,
which, as I afterwards found, was towards the capital city, about half
a mile distant, whither it was agreed by his Majesty in council that I
must be conveyed. I answered in few words, but to no purpose, and made
a sign with my hand that was loose, putting it to the other (but
over his Excellency's head, for fear of hurting him or his train)
and then to my own head and body, to signify that I desired my
liberty. It appeared that he understood me well enough, for he shook
his head by way of disapprobation, and held his hand in a posture to
show that I must be carried as a prisoner. However, he made other
signs to let me understand that I should have meat and drink enough,
and very good treatment. Whereupon I once more thought of attempting
to break my bonds, but again, when I felt the smart of their arrows
upon my face and hands, which were all in blisters, and many of the
darts still sticking in them, and observing likewise that the number
of my enemies increased, I gave tokens to let them know that they
might do with me what they pleased. Upon this the Hurgo and his
train withdrew with much civility and cheerful countenances. Soon
after I heard a general shout, with frequent repetitions of the words,
Peplom selan, and I felt great numbers of the people on my left side
relaxing the cords to such a degree, that I was able to turn upon my
right, and to ease myself with making water; which I very
plentifully did, to the great astonishment of the who conjecturing
by my motions what I was going to do, immediately opened to the
right and left on that side, to avoid the torrent which fell with such
noise and violence from me. But before this, they had daubed my face
and both my hands with a sort of ointment very pleasant to the
smell, which in a few minutes removed all the smart of their arrows.
These circumstances, added to the refreshment I had received by
their victuals and drink, which were very nourishing, disposed me to
sleep. I slept about eight hours, as I was afterwards assured; and
it was no wonder, for the physicians, by the Emperor's order, had
mingled a sleepy potion in the hogsheads of wine.
{P_1|CH_1 ^paragraph 5}
It seems that upon the first moment I was discovered sleeping on the
ground after my landing, the Emperor had early notice of it by an
express; and determined in council that I should be tied in the manner
I have related (which was done in the night while I slept), that
plenty of meat and drink should be sent me, and a machine prepared
to carry me to the capital city.
This resolution perhaps may appear very bold and dangerous, and I am
confident would not be imitated by any prince in Europe on the like
occasion; however, in my opinion, it was extremely prudent, as well as
generous. For supposing these people had endeavored to kill me with
their spears and arrows while I was asleep, I should certainly have
awakened with the first sense of smart, which might so far have roused
my rage and strength, as to have enabled me to break the strings
wherewith I was tied; after which, as they were not able to make
resistance, so they could expect no mercy.
These people are most excellent mathematicians, and arrived to great
perfection in mechanics by the countenance and encouragement of the
Emperor, who is a renowned patron of learning. This prince has several
machines fixed on wheels for the carriage of trees and other great
weights. He often builds his largest men of war, whereof some are nine
feet long, in the woods where the timber grows, and has them carried
on these engines three or four hundred yards to the sea. Five
hundred carpenters and engineers were immediately set at work to
prepare the greatest engine they had. It was a frame of wood raised
three inches from the ground, about seven feet long and four wide,
moving upon twenty-two wheels. The shout I heard was upon the
arrival of this engine, which it seems set out in four hours after
my landing. It was brought parallel to me as I lay. But the
principal difficulty was to raise and place me in this vehicle. Eighty
poles, each of one foot high, were erected for this purpose, and
very strong cords of the bigness of packthread were fastened by
hooks to many bandages, which the workmen had girt round my neck, my
hands, my body, and my legs. Nine hundred of the strongest men were
employed to draw up these cords by many pulleys fastened on the poles,
and thus, in less than three hours, I was raised and slung into the
engine, and there tied fast. All this I was told, for while the
whole operation was performing, I lay in a profound sleep, by the
force of that soporiferous medicine infused into my liquor. Fifteen
hundred of the Emperor's largest horses, each about four inches and
a half high, were employed to draw me towards the metropolis, which,
as I said, was half a mile distant.
About four hours after we began our journey, I awaked by a very
ridiculous accident; for the carriage being stopped a while to
adjust something that was out of order, two or three of the young
natives had the curiosity to see how I looked when I was asleep;
they climbed up into the engine, and advancing very softly to my face,
one of them, an officer in the Guards, put the sharp end of his
half-pike a good way up into my left nostril, which tickled my nose
like a straw, and made me sneeze violently: whereupon they stole off
unperceived, and it was three weeks before I knew the cause of my
awaking so suddenly. We made a long march the remaining part of that
day, and rested at night with five hundred guards on each side of
me, half with torches, and half with bows and arrows, ready to shoot
me if I should offer to stir. The next morning at sunrise we continued
our march, and arrived within two hundred yards of the city gates
about noon. The Emperor, and all his court, came out to meet us; but
his great officers would by no means suffer his Majesty to endanger
his person by mounting on my body.
At the place where the carriage stopped, there stood an ancient
temple, esteemed to be the largest in the whole kingdom, which
having been polluted some years before by an unnatural murder, was,
according to the zeal of those people, looked on as profane, and
therefore had been applied to common uses, and all the ornaments and
furniture carried away. In this edifice it was determined I should
lodge. The great gate fronting to the north was about four feet
high, and almost two feet wide, through which I could easily creep. On
each side of the gate was a small window not above six inches from the
ground: into that on the left side, the King's smiths conveyed
fourscore and eleven chains, like those that hang to a lady's watch in
Europe, and almost as large, which were locked to my left leg with six
and thirty padlocks. Over against this temple, on the other side of
the great highway, at twenty feet distance, there was a turret at
least five feet high. Here the Emperor ascended with many principal
lords of his court, to have an opportunity of viewing me, as I was
told, for I could not see them. It was reckoned that above a hundred
thousand inhabitants came out of the town upon the same errand; and in
spite of my guards, I believe there could not be fewer than ten
thousand, at several times, who mounted upon my body by the help of
ladders. But a proclamation was soon issued to forbid it upon pain
of death. When the workmen found it was impossible for me to break
loose, they cut all the strings that bound me; whereupon I rose up
with as melancholy a disposition as ever I had in my life. But the
noise and astonishment of the people at seeing me rise and walk, are
not to be expressed. The chains that held my left leg were about two
yards long, and gave me not only the liberty of walking backwards
and forwards in a semi-circle; but, being fixed within four inches
of the gate, allowed me to creep in, and lie at my full length in
the temple.

CHAPTER II
-
When I found myself on my feet, I looked about me, and must
confess I never beheld a more entertaining prospect. The country round
appeared like a continued garden, and the inclosed fields, which
were generally forty feet square, resembled so many beds of flowers.
These fields were intermingled with woods of half a sting, and the
tallest trees, as I could judge, appeared to be seven feet high. I
viewed the town on my left hand, which looked like the painted scene
of a city in a theatre.
I had been for some hours extremely pressed by the necessities of
nature; which was no wonder, it being almost two days since I had last
unburdened myself. I was under great difficulties between urgency
and shame. The best expedient I could think of, was to creep into my
house, which I accordingly did; and shutting the gate after me, I went
as far as the length of my chain would suffer, and discharged my
body of that uneasy load. But this was the only time I was ever guilty
of so uncleanly an action; for which I cannot but hope the candid
reader will give some allowance, after he has maturely and impartially
considered my case, and the distress I was in. From this time my
constant practice was, as soon as I rose, to perform that business
in open air, at the full extent of my chain, and due care was taken
every morning before company came, that the offensive matter should be
carried off in wheelbarrows, by two servants appointed for that
purpose. I would not have dwelt so long upon a circumstance, that
perhaps at first sight may appear not very momentous, if I had not
thought it necessary to justify my character in point of cleanliness
to the world; which I am told some of my maligners have been
pleased, upon this and other occasions, to call in question.
When this adventure was at an end, I came back out of my house,
having occasion for fresh air. The Emperor was already descended
from the tower, and advancing on horseback towards me, which had
like to have cost him dear; for the beast, though very well trained,
yet wholly unused to such a sight, which appeared as if a mountain
moved before him, he reared up on his hinder feet: but that prince,
who is an excellent horseman, kept his seat, till his attendants ran
in, and held the bridle, while his Majesty had time to dismount.
When he alighted, he surveyed me round with great admiration, but kept
without the length of my chain. He ordered his cooks and butlers,
who were already prepared, to give me victuals and drink, which they
pushed forward in a sort of vehicle upon wheels till I could reach
them. I took these vehicles, and soon emptied them all; twenty of them
were filled with meat, and ten with liquor; each of the former
afforded me two or three good mouthfuls, and I emptied the liquor of
ten vessels, which was contained in earthen vials, into one vehicle,
drinking it off at a draught; and so I did with the rest. The Empress,
and young Princes of the blood, of both sexes, attended by many
ladies, sat at some distance in their chairs; but upon the accident
that happened to the Emperor's horse, they alighted, and came near his
person, which I am now going to describe. He is taller by almost the
breadth of my nail than any of his court, which alone is enough to
strike an awe into the beholders. His features are strong and
masculine, with an Austrian lip and arched nose, his complexion olive,
his countenance erect, his body and limbs well proportioned, all his
motions graceful, and his deportment majestic. He was then past his
prime, being twenty-eight years and three quarters old, of which he
had reigned about seven, in great felicity, and generally
victorious. For the better convenience of beholding him, I lay on my
side, so that my face was parallel to his, and he stood but three
yards off: however, I have had him since many times in my hand, and
therefore cannot be deceived in the description. His dress was very
plain and simple, and the fashion of it between the Asiatic and the
European; but he had on his head a light helmet of gold, adorned
with jewels, and a plume on the crest. He held his sword drawn in
his hand, to defend himself, if I should happen to break loose; it was
almost three inches long, the hilt and scabbard were gold enriched
with diamonds. His voice was shrill, but very clear and articulate,
and I could distinctly hear it when I stood up. The ladies and
courtiers were all most magnificently clad, so that the spot they
stood upon seemed to resemble a petticoat spread on the ground,
embroidered with figures of gold and silver. His Imperial Majesty
spoke often to me, and I returned answers, but neither of us could
understand a syllable. There were several of his priests and lawyers
present (as I conjectured by their habits) who were commanded to
address themselves to me, and I spoke to them in as many languages
as I had the least smattering of, which were High and Low Dutch,
Latin, French, Spanish, Italian, and Lingua Franca; but all to no
purpose. After about two hours the court retired, and I was left
with a strong guard, to prevent the impertinence, and probably the
malice of the rabble, who were very impatient to crowd about me as
near as they dare, and some of them had the impudence to shoot their
arrows at me as I sat on the ground by the door of my house, whereof
one very narrowly missed my left eye. But the colonel ordered six of
the ringleaders to be seized, and thought no punishment so proper as
to deliver them bound into my hands, which some of his soldiers
accordingly did, pushing them forwards with the butt-ends of their
pikes into my reach; I took them all in my right hand, put five of
them into my coat pocket, and as to the sixth, I made a countenance as
if I would eat him alive. The poor man squalled terribly, and the
colonel and his officers were in much pain, especially when they saw
me take out my penknife: but I soon put them out of fear; for, looking
mildly, and immediately cutting the strings he was bound with, I set
him gently on the ground, and away he ran. I treated the rest in the
same manner, taking them one by one out of my pocket, and I observed
both the soldiers and people were highly obliged at this mark of my
clemency, which was represented very much to my advantage at court.
Towards night I with some difficulty got into my house, where I
lay on the ground, and continued to do so about a fortnight; during
which time the Emperor gave orders to have a bed prepared for me.
Six hundred beds of the common measure were brought in carriages,
and worked up in my house; a hundred and fifty of their beds sewn
together made up the breadth and length, and these were four double,
which however kept me but very indifferently from the hardness of
the floor, that was of smooth stone. By the same computation they
provided me with sheets, blankets, and coverlets, tolerable enough for
one who had been so long inured to hardships as I.
As the news of my arrival spread through the kingdom, it brought
prodigious numbers of rich, idle, and curious people to see me; so
that the villages were almost emptied, and great neglect of tillage
and household affairs must have ensued, if his Imperial Majesty had
not provided, by several proclamations and orders of state, against
this inconveniency. He directed that those who had already beheld me
should return home, and not presume to come within fifty yards of my
house without license from court; whereby the secretaries of state got
considerable fees.
{P_1|CH_2 ^paragraph 5}
In the meantime, the Emperor held frequent councils to debate what
course should be taken with me; and I was afterwards assured by a
particular friend, a person of great quality, who was looked upon to
be as much in the secret as any, that the court was under many
difficulties concerning me. They apprehended my breaking loose, that
my diet would be very expensive, and might cause a famine. Sometimes
they determined to starve me, or at least to shoot me in the face
and hands with poisoned arrows, which would soon dispatch me: but
again they considered, that the stench of so large a carcass might
produce a plague in the metropolis, and probably spread through the
whole kingdom. In the midst of these consultations, several officers
of the army went to the door of the great council chamber; and two
of them being admitted, gave an account of my behavior to the six
criminals above mentioned, which made so favorable an impression in
the breast of his Majesty and the whole board in my behalf, that an
Imperial Commission was issued out, obliging all the villages nine
hundred yards round the city, to deliver in every morning six
beeves, forty sheep, and other victuals for my sustenance; together
with a proportionable quantity of bread, and wine, and other liquors
for the due payment of which his Majesty gave assignments upon his
treasury. For this prince lives chiefly upon his own demesnes, seldom,
except upon great occasions, raising any subsidies upon his
subjects, who are bound to attend him in his wars at their own
expense. An establishment was-also made of six hundred persons to be
my domestics, who had board-wages allowed for their maintenance, and
tents built for them very conveniently on each side of my door. It was
likewise ordered, that three hundred tailors should make me a suit
of clothes after the fashion of the country: that six of his Majesty's
greatest scholars should be employed to instruct me in their language:
and, lastly, that the Emperor's horses, and those of the nobility, and
troops of guards, should be frequently exercised in my sight, to
accustom themselves to me. All these orders were duly put in
execution, and in about three weeks I made a great progress in
learning their language; during which time the Emperor frequently
honored me with his visits, and was pleased to assist my masters in
teaching me. We began already to converse together in some sort; and
the first words I learned were to express my desire that he would
please give me my liberty, which I every day repeated on my knees. His
answer, as I could apprehend it, was, that this must be a work of
time, not to be thought on without the advice of his council, and that
first I must Lumos kelmin pesso desmar lon Emposo; that is, swear a
peace with him and his kingdom. However, that I should be used with
all kindness; and he advised me to acquire, by my patience and
discreet behavior, the good opinion of himself and his subjects. He
desired I would not take it ill, if he gave orders to certain proper
officers to search me; for probably I might carry about me several
weapons, which must needs be dangerous things, if they answered the
bulk of so prodigious a person. I said, his Majesty should be
satisfied, for I was ready to strip myself, and turn out my pockets
before him. This I delivered part in words, and part in signs. He
replied, that by the laws of the kingdom I must be searched by two
of his officers; that he knew this could not be done without my
consent and assistance; that he had so good an opinion of my
generosity and justice, as to trust their persons in my hands: that
whatever they took from me should be returned when I left the country,
or paid for at the rate which I would set upon them. I took up the two
officers in my hands, put them first into my coat-pockets, and then
into every other pocket about me, except my two fobs, and another
secret pocket I had no mind should be searched, wherein I had some
little necessaries that were of no consequence to any but myself. In
one of my fobs there was a silver watch, and in the other a small
quantity of gold in a purse. These gentlemen, having pen, ink, and
paper about them, made an exact inventory of everything they saw;
and when they were through, desired I would set them down, that they
might deliver it to the Emperor. This inventory I afterwards
translated that into English, and is word for word as follows.
-
Imprimis, In the right coat pocket of the Great Man Mountain (for so
I interpret the words Quinbus Flestrin) after the strictest search, we
found only one great piece of coarse cloth, large enough to be a
foot cloth for your Majesty's chief room of state. In the left
pocket we saw a huge silver chest, with a cover of the same metal,
which we the searchers were not able to lift. We desired it should
be opened, and one of us stepping into it, found himself up to the mid
leg in a sort of dust, some part whereof flying up to our faces, set
us both sneezing for several times together. In his right waistcoat
pocket we found a prodigious bundle of white thin substances, folded
one over another, about the bigness of three men, tied with a strong
cable, and marked with black figures; which we humbly conceive to be
writings, every letter almost half as large as the palm of our
hands. In the left there was a sort of engine, from the back of
which were extended twenty long poles, resembling the palisades before
your Majesty's court; wherewith we conjecture the Man-Mountain combs
his head, for we did not always trouble him with questions, because we
found it a great difficulty to make him understand us. In the large
pocket on the right side of his middle cover (so I translate the
word ranfu-lo, by which they meant my breeches) we saw a hollow pillar
of iron, about the length of a man, fastened to a strong piece of
timber, larger than the pillar; and upon one side of the pillar were
huge pieces of iron sticking out, cut into strange figures, which we
know not what to make of. In the left pocket, another engine of the
same kind. In the smaller pocket on the right side, were several round
flat pieces of white and red metal, of different bulk; some of the
white, which seemed to be silver, were so large and heavy, that my
comrade and I could hardly lift them. In the left pocket were two
black pillars irregularly shaped: we could not, without difficulty,
reach the top of them as we stood at the bottom of his pocket. One
of them was covered, and seemed all of a piece: but at the upper end
of the other, there appeared a white round substance, about twice
the bigness of our heads. Within each of these was enclosed a
prodigious plate of steel; which, by our orders, we obliged him to
show us, because we apprehended they might be dangerous engines. He
took them out of their cases, and told us, that in his own country his
practice was to shave his beard with one of these, and to cut his meat
with the other. There were two pockets which we could not enter: these
he called his fobs; they were two large slits cut into the top of
his middle cover, but squeezed close by the pressure of his belly. Out
of the right fob hung a great silver chain, with a wonderful kind of
engine at the bottom. We directed him to draw out whatever was
fastened to that chain; which appeared to be a globe, half silver, and
half of some transparent metal: for on the transparent side we saw
certain strange figures circularly drawn, and thought we could touch
them, till we found our fingers stopped by that lucid substance. He
put this engine to our ears, which made an incessant noise like that
of a watermill: and we conjecture it is either some unknown animal, or
the god that he worships; but we are more inclined to the latter
opinion, because he assured us (if we understood him right, for he
expressed himself very imperfectly) that he seldom did anything
without consulting it: he called it his oracle, and said it pointed
out the time for every action of his life. From the left fob he took
out a net almost large enough for a fisherman, but contrived to open
and shut like a purse, and serve him for the same use: we found
therein several massy pieces of yellow metal, which, if they be real
gold, must be of immense value.
Having thus, in obedience to your Majesty's commands, diligently
searched all his pockets, we observed a girdle about his waist made of
the hide of some prodigious animal; from which, on the left side, hung
a sword of the length of five men; and on the right, a bag or pouch
divided into two cells, each cell capable of holding three of your
Majesty's subjects. In one of these cells were several globes or balls
of a most ponderous metal, about the bigness of our heads, and
requiring a strong hand to lift them: the other cell contained a
heap of certain black grains, but of no great bulk or weight, for we
could hold above fifty of them in the palms of our hands.
This is an exact inventory of what we found about the body of the
Man-Mountain, who used us with great civility, and due respect to your
Majesty's commission. Signed and sealed on the fourth day of the
eighty-ninth moon of your Majesty's auspicious reign.

When this inventory was read over to the Emperor, he directed me,
although in very gentle terms, to deliver up the several
particulars. He first called for my scimitar, which I took out,
scabbard and all. In the meantime he ordered three thousand of his
choicest troops (who then attended him) to surround me at a
distance, with their bows and arrows just ready to discharge: but I
did not observe it, for my eyes were wholly fixed upon his Majesty. He
then desired me to draw my scimitar, which, although it had got some
rust by the sea water, was in most parts exceeding bright. I did so,
and immediately all the troops gave a shout between terror and
surprise; for the sun shone clear, and the reflection dazzled their
eyes as I waved the scimitar to and fro in my hand. His Majesty, who
is a most magnanimous prince, was less daunted than I could expect; he
ordered me to return it into the scabbard, and cast it on the ground
as gently as I could, about six foot from the end of my chain. The
next thing he demanded was one of the hollow iron pillars, by which he
meant my pocket-pistols. I drew it out, and at his desire, as well
as I could, expressed to him the use of it; and charging it only
with powder, which by the closeness of my pouch happened to escape
wetting in the sea (an inconvenience against which all prudent
mariners take special care to provide) I first cautioned the Emperor
not to be afraid, and then I let it off in the air. The astonishment
here was much greater than at the sight of my scimitar. Hundreds
fell down as if they had been struck dead; and even the Emperor,
although he stood his ground, could not recover himself in some
time. I delivered up both my pistols in the same manner as I had
done my scimitar, and then my pouch of powder and bullets; begging him
that the former might be kept from the fire, for it would kindle
with the smallest spark, and blow up his imperial palace into the air.
I likewise delivered up my watch, which the Emperor was very curious
to see, and commanded two of his tallest yeomen of the guards to
bear it on a pole upon their shoulders, as draymen in England do a
barrel of ale. He was amazed at the continual noise it made, and the
motion of the minute-hand, which he could easily discern; for their
sight is much more acute than ours; and asked the opinions of his
learned men about him, which were various and remote, as the reader
may well imagine without my repeating; although indeed I could not
very perfectly understand them. I then gave up my silver and copper
money, my purse with nine large pieces of gold, and some smaller ones;
my knife and razor, my comb and silver snuff-box, my handkerchief and
journal-book. My scimitar, pistols, and pouch, were conveyed in
carriages to his Majesty's stores; but the rest of my goods were
returned me.
I had, as I before observed, one private pocket which escaped
their search, wherein there was a pair of spectacles (which I
sometimes use for the weakness of my eyes), a pocket perspective,
and several other little conveniences; which, being of no
consequence to the Emperor, I did not think myself bound in honor to
discover, and I apprehended they might be lost or spoiled if I
ventured them out of my possession.

CHAPTER III
-
My gentleness and good behavior had gained so far on the Emperor and
his court, and indeed upon the army and people in general, that I
began to conceive hopes of getting my liberty in a short time. I
took all possible methods to cultivate this favorable disposition. The
natives came by degrees to be less apprehensive of any danger from me.
I would sometimes lie down, and let five or six of them dance on my
hand. And last the boys and girls would venture to come and play at
hide and seek in my hair. I had now made good progress in
understanding and speaking their language. The Emperor had a mind
one day to entertain me with several of the country shows, wherein
they exceeded all nations I have known, both for dexterity and
magnificence. I was diverted with none so much as that of the
rope-dancers, performed upon a slender white thread, extended about
two feet, and twelve inches from the ground. Upon which I shall desire
liberty, with the reader's patience, to enlarge a little.
This diversion is only practiced by those persons who are candidates
for great employments and high favors at court. They are trained in
this art from their youth, and are not always of noble birth, or
liberal education. When a great office is vacant either by death or
disgrace (which often happens) five or six of those candidates
petition the Emperor to entertain his Majesty and the court with a
dance on the rope, and whoever jumps the highest without falling,
succeeds in the office. Very often the chief ministers themselves
are commanded to show their skill, and to convince the Emperor that
they have not lost their faculty. Flimnap, the Treasurer, is allowed
to cut a caper on the straight rope, at least an inch higher than
any other lord in the whole empire. I have seen him do the summerset
several times together upon a trencher fixed on the rope, which is
no thicker than a common packthread in England. My friend Reldresal,
principal Secretary for Private Affairs, is, in my opinion, if I am
not partial, the second after the Treasurer; the rest of the great
officers are much upon a par.
These diversions are often attended with fatal accidents, whereof
great numbers are on record. I myself have seen two or three
candidates break a limb. But the danger is much greater when the
ministers themselves are commanded to show their dexterity; for by
contending to excell themselves and their fellows, they strain so far,
that there is hardly one of them who has not received a fall, and some
of them two or three. I was assured that a year or two before my
arrival, Flimnap would have infallibly broken his neck, if one of
the King's cushions, that accidentally lay on the ground, had not
weakened the force of his fall.
There is likewise another diversion, which is only shown before
the Emperor and Empress, and first minister, upon particular
occasions. The Emperor lays on the table three fine silken threads
of six inches long. One is blue, the other red, and the third green.
These threads are proposed as prizes for those persons whom the
Emperor has a mind to distinguish by a peculiar mark of his favor. The
ceremony is performed in his Majesty's great chamber of state, where
the candidates are to undergo a trial of dexterity very different from
the former, and such as I have not observed the least resemblance of
in any other country of the old or the new world. The Emperor holds
a stick in his hands, both ends parallel to the horizon, while the
candidates, advancing one by one, sometimes leap over the stick,
sometimes creep under it backwards and forwards several times,
according as the stick is advanced or depressed. Sometimes the Emperor
holds one end of the stick, and his first minister the other;
sometimes the minister has it entirely to himself. Whoever performs
his part with most agility, and holds out the longest in leaping and
creeping, is rewarded with the blue-colored silk; the red is given
to the next, and the green to the third, which they all wear girt
twice round about the middle; and you see few great persons about this
court who are not adorned with one of these girdles.
The horses of the army, and those of the royal stables, having
been daily led before me, were no longer shy, but would come up to
my very feet without starting. The riders would leap them over my hand
as I held it on the ground, and one of the Emperor's huntsmen, upon
a large courser, took my foot, shoe and all; which was indeed a
prodigious leap. I had the good fortune to divert the Emperor one
day after a very extraordinary manner. I desired he would order
several sticks two feet high, and the thickness of an ordinary cane,
to be brought me; whereupon his Majesty commanded the master of his
woods to give directions accordingly; and the next morning six woodmen
arrived with as many carriages, drawn by eight horses to each. I
took nine of these sticks, and fixing them firmly in the ground in a
quadrangular figure, two feet and a half square, I took four other
sticks, and tied them parallel at each corner, about two feet from the
ground; then I fastened my handkerchief to the nine sticks that
stood erect, and extended it on all sides till it was as tight as
the top of a drum; and the four parallel sticks rising about five
inches higher than the handkerchief served as ledges on each side.
When I had finished my work, I desired the Emperor to let a troop of
his best horse, twentyfour in number, come and exercise upon this
plain. His Majesty approved of the proposal, and I took them up one by
one in my hands, ready mounted and armed, with the proper officers
to exercise them. As soon as they got into order, they divided into
two parties, performed mock skirmishes, discharged blunt arrows,
drew their swords, fled and pursued, attacked and retired, and in
short discovered the best military discipline I ever beheld. The
parallel sticks secured them and their horses from falling over the
stage; and the Emperor was so much delighted, that he ordered this
entertainment to be repeated several days, and once was pleased to
be lifted up and give the word of command; and, with great difficulty,
persuaded even the Empress herself to let me hold her in her close
chair within two yards of the stage, from whence she was able to
take a full view of the whole performance. It was my good fortune that
no ill accident happened in these entertainments, only once a fiery
horse that belonged to one of the captains pawing with his hoof struck
a hole in my handkerchief, and his foot slipping, he overthrew his
rider and himself; but I immediately relieved them both, and
covering the hole with one hand, I set down the troop with the
other, in the same manner as I took them up. The horse that fell was
strained in the left shoulder, but the rider got no hurt, and I
repaired my handkerchief as well as I could: however I would not trust
to the strength of it any more in such dangerous enterprises.
{P_1|CH_3 ^paragraph 5}
About two or three days before I was set at liberty, as I was
entertaining the court with these kind of feats, there arrived an
express to inform his Majesty that some of his subjects riding near
the place where I was first taken up, had seen a great black substance
lying on the ground, very oddly shaped, extending its edges round as
wide as his Majesty's bedchamber, and rising up in the middle as
high as a man; that it was no living creature, as they at first
apprehended, for it lay on the grass without motion, and some of
them had walked round it several tunes: that by mounting upon each
other's shoulders, they had got to the top, which was flat and even,
and stamping upon it they found it was hollow within; that they humbly
conceived it might be something belonging to the Man-Mountain, and
if his Majesty pleased, they would undertake to bring it with only
five horses. I presently knew what they meant, and was glad at heart
to receive this intelligence. It seems upon my first reaching the
shore after our shipwreck, I was in such confusion, that before I came
to the place where I went to sleep, my hat, which I had fastened
with a string to my head while I was rowing, and had stuck on all
the time I was swimming, fell off after I came to land; the string, as
I conjecture, breaking by some accident which I never observed, but
thought my hat had been lost at sea. I entreated his Imperial
Majesty to give orders it might be brought to me as soon as
possible, describing to him the use and the nature of it: and the next
day the wagoners arrived with it, but not in a very good condition;
they had bored two holes in the brim, within an inch and a half of the
edge, and fastened two hooks in the holes; these hooks were tied by
a long cord to the harness, and thus my hat was dragged along for
above half an English mile: but the ground in that country being
extremely smooth and level, it received less damage than I expected.
Two days after this adventure, the Emperor having ordered that
part of his army which quarters in and about his metropolis to be in a
readiness, took a fancy of diverting himself in a very singular
manner. He desired I would stand like a Colossus, with my legs as
far asunder as I conveniently could. He then commanded his General
(who was an old experienced leader, and a great patron of mine) to
draw up the troops in close order, and march them under me, the foot
by twentyfour in a breast, and the horse by sixteen, with drums
beating, colors flying, and pikes advanced. This body consisted of
three thousand foot, and a thousand horse. His Majesty gave orders,
upon pain of death, that every soldier in his march should observe the
strictest decency with regard to my person; which, however, could
not prevent some of the younger officers from turning up their eyes as
they passed under me. And, to confess the truth, my breeches were at
that time in so ill a condition, that they afforded some opportunities
for laughter and admiration.
I had sent so many memorials and petitions for my liberty, that
his Majesty at length mentioned the matter, first in the cabinet,
and then in a full council; where it was opposed by none, except
Skyresh Bolgolam, who was pleased, without any provocation, to be my
mortal enemy. But it was carried against him by the whole board, and
confirmed by the Emperor. That minister was Galbet, or Admiral of
the Realm, very much in his master's confidence, and a person well
versed in affairs, but of a morose and sour complexion. However, he
was at length persuaded to comply; but prevailed that the articles and
conditions upon which I should be set free, and to which I must swear,
should be drawn up by himself. These articles were brought to me by
Skyresh Bolgolam in person, attended by two under-secretaries, and
several persons of distinction. After they were read, I was demanded
to swear to the performance of them; first in the manner of my own
country, and afterwards in the method prescribed by their laws;
which was to hold my right foot in my left hand, to place the middle
finger of my right hand on the crown of my head, and my thumb on the
tip of my right ear. But because the reader may perhaps be curious
to have some idea of the style and manner of expression peculiar to
that people, as well as to know the articles upon which I recovered my
liberty, I have made a translation of the whole instrument word for
word, as near as I was able, which I here offer to the public.
-
GOLBASTO MOMAREN EVLAME GURDILO SHEFIN MULLY ULLY GUE, most mighty
Emperor of Lilliput, delight and terror of the universe, whose
dominions extend five thousand blustrugs (about twelve miles in
circumference) to the extremities of the globe; monarch of all
monarchs, taller than the sons of men; whose feet press down to the
center, and whose head strikes against the sun; at whose nod the
princes of the earth shake their knees; pleasant as the spring,
comfortable as the summer, fruitful as autumn, dreadful as winter. His
most sublime Majesty proposes to the Man-Mountain, lately arrived to
our celestial dominions, the following articles, which by a solemn
oath he shall be obliged to perform.
{P_1|CH_3 ^paragraph 10}
First, The Man-Mountain shall not depart from our dominions, without
our license under our great seal.
2nd, He shall not presume to come into our metropolis, without our
express order; at which time the inhabitants shall have two hours
warning to keep within their doors.
3rd, The said Man-Mountain shall confine his walks to our
principal high roads, and not offer to walk or lie down in a meadow or
field of corn.
4th, As he walks the said roads, he shall take the utmost care not
to trample upon the bodies of any of our loving subjects, their
horses, or carriages, nor take any of our said subjects into his
hands, without their own consent.
5th, If an express requires extraordinary dispatch, the Man-Mountain
shall be obliged to carry in his pocket the messenger and horse a
six days journey once in every moon, and return the said messenger
back (if so required) safe to our Imperial Presence.
{P_1|CH_3 ^paragraph 15}
6th, He shall be our ally against our enemies in the Island of
Blefuscu, and do his utmost to destroy their fleet, which is now
preparing to invade us.
7th, That the said Man-Mountain shall, at his times of leisure, be
aiding and assisting to our workmen, in helping to raise certain great
stones, towards covering the wall of the principal park, and other
of our royal buildings.
8th, That the said Man-Mountain shall, in two moons' time, deliver
in an exact survey of the circumference of our dominions by a
computation of his own paces round the coast.
Lastly, That upon his solemn oath to observe all the above
articles, the said Man-Mountain shall have a daily allowance of meat
and drink sufficient for the support of 1,728 of our subjects, with
free access to our Royal Person, and other marks of our favor. Given
at our Palace at Belfaborac the twelfth day of the ninety-first moon
of our reign.
-
{P_1|CH_3 ^paragraph 20}
I swore and subscribed to these articles with great cheerfulness and
content, although some of them were not so honorable as I could have
wished; which proceeded wholly from the malice of Skyresh Bolgolam the
High Admiral: whereupon my chains were immediately unlocked, and I was
at full liberty; the Emperor himself in person did me the honor to
be by at the whole ceremony. I made my acknowledgments by
prostrating myself at his Majesty's feet: but he commanded me to rise;
and after many gracious expressions, which, to avoid the censure of
vanity, I shall not repeat, he added, that he hoped I should prove a
useful servant, and well deserve all the favors he had already
conferred upon me, or might do for the future.
The reader may please to observe, that in the last article for the
recovery of my liberty the Emperor stipulates to allow me a quantity
of meat and drink sufficient for the support of 1,728 Lilliputians.
Some time after, asking a friend at court how they came to fix on that
determinate number, he told me that his Majesty's mathematicians,
having taken the height of my body by the help of a quadrant, and
finding it to exceed theirs in the proportion of twelve to one, they
concluded from the similarity of their bodies, that mine must
contain at least 1,728 of theirs, and consequently would require as
much food as was necessary to support that number of Lilliputians.
By which the reader may conceive an idea of the ingenuity of that
people, as well as the prudent and exact economy of so great a prince.

P_1|CH_4
CHAPTER IV
-
The first request I made after I had obtained my liberty, was,
that I might have license to see Mildendo, the metropolis, which the
Emperor easily granted me, but with a special charge to do no hurt
either to the inhabitants or their houses. The people had notice by
proclamation of my design to visit the town. The wall which
encompassed it is two feet and a half high, and at least eleven inches
broad, so that a coach and horses may be driven very safely round
it; and it is flanked with strong towers at ten feet distance. I
stepped over the great Gate, and passed very gently, and sidering
through the two principal streets, only in my short waistcoat, for
fear of damaging the roofs and eaves of the houses with the skirts
of my coat. I walked with the utmost circumspection, to avoid treading
on any stragglers, that might remain in the streets, although the
orders were very strict, that all people should keep in their houses
at their own peril. The garret windows and tops of houses were so
crowded with spectators, that I thought in all my travels I had not
seen a more populous place. The city is an exact square, each side
of the wall being five hundred feet long. The two great streets, which
run cross and divide it into four quarters, are five feet wide. The
lanes and alleys, which I could not enter, but only viewed them as I
passed, are from twelve to eighteen inches. The town is capable of
holding five hundred thousand souls. The houses are from three to five
stories. The shops and markets well provided.
The Emperor's palace is in the centre of the city, where the two
great streets meet. It is enclosed by a wall of two feet high, and
twenty feet distant from the buildings. I had his Majesty's permission
to step over this wall; and the space being so wide between that and
the palace, I could easily view it on every side. The outward court is
a square of forty feet, and includes two other courts: in the inmost
are the royal apartments, which I was very desirous to see, but
found it extremely difficult; for the great gates, from one square
into another, were but eighteen inches high and seven inches wide. Now
the buildings of the outer court were at least five feet high, and
it was impossible for me to stride over them without infinite damage
to the pile, though the walls were strongly built of hewn stone, and
four inches thick. At the same time the Emperor had a great desire
that I should see the magnificence of his palace; but this I was not
able to do till three days after, which I spent in cutting down with
my knife some of the largest trees in the royal park, about a
hundred yards distant from the city. Of these trees I made two stools,
each about three feet high, and strong enough to bear my weight. The
people having received notice a second time, I went again through
the city to the palace, with my two stools in my hands. When I came to
the side of the outer court, I stood upon one stool, and took the
other in my hand: this I lifted over the roof, and gently set it
down on the space between the first and second court, which was
eight feet wide. I then stepped over the buildings very conveniently
from one stool to the other, and drew up the first after me with a
hooked stick. By this contrivance I got into the inmost court; and
lying down upon my side, I applied my face to the windows of the
middle stories, which were left open on purpose, and discovered the
most splendid apartments that can be imagined. There I saw the Empress
and the young Princes, in their several lodgings, with their chief
attendants about them. Her Imperial Majesty was pleased to smile
very graciously upon me, and gave me out of the window her hand to
kiss.
But I shall not anticipate the reader with farther descriptions of
this kind, because I reserve them for a greater work, which is now
almost ready for the press, containing a general description of this
empire, from its first erection, through a long series of princes,
with a particular account of their wars and politics, laws,
learning, and religion: their plants and animals, their peculiar
manners and customs, with other matters very curious and useful; my
chief design at present being only to relate such events and
transactions as happened to the public, or to myself, during a
residence of about nine months in that empire.
One morning, about a fortnight after I had obtained my liberty,
Reldresal, principal Secretary (as they style him) of Private Affairs,
came to my house attended only by one servant. He ordered his coach to
wait at a distance, and desired I would give him an hour's audience;
which I readily consented to, on account of his quality and personal
merits, as well as the many good offices he had done me during my
solicitations at court. I offered to lie down, that he might the
more conveniently reach my ear; but he chose rather to let me hold him
in my hand during our conversation. He began with compliments on my
liberty; said he might pretend to some merit in it: but, however,
added, that if it had not been for the present situation of things
at court, perhaps I might not have obtained it so soon. For, said
he, as flourishing a condition as we may appear to be in to
foreigners, we labor under two mighty evils; a violent faction at
home, and the danger of an invasion by a most potent enemy from
abroad. As to the first, you are to understand, that for above seventy
moons past there have been two struggling parties in this empire,
under the names of Tramecksan and Slamecksan, from the high and low
heels on their shoes, by which they distinguish themselves. It is
alleged indeed, that the high heels are most agreeable to our
ancient constitution: but however this be, his Majesty has
determined to make use of only low heels in the administration of
the government, and all offices in the gift of the Crown, as you
cannot but observe; and particularly, that his Majesty's Imperial
heels are lower at least by a drurr than any of his court; (drurr is a
measure about the fourteenth part of an inch). The animosities between
these two parties run so high, that they will neither eat nor drink,
nor talk with each other. We compute the Tramecksan, or High-Heels, to
exceed us in number; but the power is wholly on our side. We apprehend
his Imperial Highness, the Heir to the Crown, to have some tendency
towards the High-Heels; at least we can plainly discover one of his
heels higher than the other, which gives him a hobble in his gait.
Now, in the midst of these intestine disquiets, we are threatened with
an invasion from the Island of Blefuscu, which is the other great
empire of the universe, almost as large and powerful as this of his
Majesty. For as to what we have heard you affirm, that there are other
kingdoms and states in the world inhabited by human creatures as large
as yourself, our philosophers are in much doubt, and would rather
conjecture that you dropped from the moon, or one of the stars;
because it is certain, that a hundred mortals of your bulk would, in a
short time, destroy all the fruits and cattle of his Majesty's
dominions. Besides, our histories of six thousand moons make no
mention of any other regions, than the two great empires of Lilliput
and Blefuscu. Which two mighty powers have, as I was going to tell
you, been engaged in a most obstinate war for six and thirty moons
past. It began upon the following occasion. It is allowed on all
hands, that the primitive way of breaking eggs, before we eat them,
was upon the larger end: but his present Majesty's grandfather,
while he was a boy, going to eat an egg, and breaking it according
to the ancient practice, happened to cut one of his fingers. Whereupon
the Emperor his father published an edict, commanding all his
subjects, upon great penalties, to break the smaller end of their
eggs. The people so highly resented this law, that our histories
tell us there have been six rebellions raised on that account; wherein
one Emperor lost his life, and another his crown. These civil
commotions were constantly fomented by the monarchs of Blefuscu; and
when they were quelled, the exiles always fled for refuge to that
empire. It is computed, that eleven thousand persons have, at
several times, suffered death, rather than submit to break their
eggs at the smaller end. Many hundred large volumes have been
published upon this controversy: but the books of the Big-Endians have
been long forbidden, and the whole party rendered incapable by law
of holding employments. During the course of these troubles, the
Emperors of Blefuscu did frequently expostulate by their
ambassadors, accusing us of making a schism in religion, by
offending against a fundamental doctrine of our great prophet Lustrog,
in the fifty-fourth chapter of the Blundecral (which is their however,
is thought to be a mere strain upon the text: for the words are these;
That all true believers shall break their eggs at the convenient
end: and which is the convenient end, seems, in my humble opinion,
to be left to every man's conscience, or at least in the power of
the chief magistrate to determine. Now the Big-Endian exiles have
found so much credit in the Emperor of Blefuscu's court, and so much
private assistance and encouragement from their party here at home,
that a bloody war has been carried on between the two empires for
six and thirty moons with various success; during which time we have
lost forty capital ships, and a much greater number of smaller
vessels, together with thirty thousand of our best seamen and
soldiers; and the damage received by the enemy is reckoned to be
somewhat greater than ours. However, they have now equipped a numerous
fleet, and are just preparing to make a descent upon us; and his
Imperial Majesty, placing great confidence in your valor and strength,
has commanded me to lay this account of his affairs before you.
I desired the Secretary to present my humble duty to the Emperor,
and to let him know, that I thought it would not become me, who was
a foreigner, to interfere with parties; but I was ready, with the
hazard of my life, to defend his person and state against all
invaders.

CHAPTER V
-
The Empire of Blefuscu is an island situated to the
north-northeast side of Lilliput, from whence it is parted only by a
channel of eight hundred yards wide. I had not yet seen it, and upon
this notice of an intended invasion, I avoided appearing on that
side of the coast, for fear of being discovered by some of the enemy's
ships, who had received no intelligence of me, all intercourse between
the two empires having been strictly forbidden during the war, upon
pain of death, and an embargo laid by our Emperor upon all vessels
whatsoever. I communicated to his Majesty a project I had formed of
seizing the enemy's whole fleet: which, as our scouts assured us,
lay at anchor in the harbor ready to sail with the first fair wind.
I consulted the most experienced seamen, upon the depth of the
channel, which they had often plumbed, who told me, that in the middle
at high-water it was seventy glumgluffs deep, which is about six
feet of European measure; and the rest of it fifty glumgluffs at most.
I walked towards the northeast coast over against Blefuscu; and
lying down behind a hillock, took out my small pocket perspective
glass, and viewed the enemy's fleet at anchor, consisting of about
fifty men of war, and a great number of transports; I then came back
to my house, and gave order (for which I had a warrant) for a great
quantity of the strongest cable and bars of iron. The cable was
about as thick as packthread, and the bars of the length and size of a
knitting needle. I trebled the cable to make it stronger, and for
the same reason I twisted three of the iron bars together, binding the
extremities into a hook. Having thus fixed fifty hooks to as many
cables, I went back to the northeast coast, and putting off my coat,
shoes, and stockings, walked into the sea in my leather jerkin,
about half an hour before high water. I waded with what haste I could,
and swam in the middle about thirty yards till I felt ground; I
arrived at the fleet in less than half an hour. The enemy was so
frighted when they saw me, that they leaped out of their ships, and
swam to shore, where there could not be fewer than thirty thousand
souls. I then took my tackling, and fastening a hook to a hole at
the prow of each, I tied all the cords together at the end. While I
was thus employed, the enemy discharged several thousand arrows,
many of which stuck in my hands and face; and besides the excessive
smart, gave me much disturbance in my work. My greatest apprehension
was for my eyes, which I should have infallibly lost, if I had not
suddenly thought of an expedient. I kept among other little
necessaries a pair of spectacles in a private pocket, which, as I
observed before, had escaped the Emperor's searchers. These I took out
and fastened as strongly as I could upon my nose, and thus armed
went on boldly with my work in spite of the enemy's arrows, many of
which struck against the glasses of my spectacles, but without any
other effect, further than a little to discompose them. I now fastened
all the hooks, and taking the knot in my hand, began to pull; but
not a ship would stir, for they were all too fast held by their
anchors, so that the boldest part of my enterprise remained. I
therefore let go the cord, and leaving the hooks fixed to the ships, I
resolutely cut with my knife the cables that fastened the anchors,
receiving above two hundred shots in my face and hands; then I took up
the knotted end of the cables to which my hooks were tied, and with
great ease drew fifty of the enemy's men-of-war after me.
The Blefuscudians, who had not the least imagination of what I
intended, were at first confounded with astonishment. They had seen me
cut the cables, and thought my design was only to let the ships run
adrift or fall foul on each other: but when they perceived the whole
fleet moving in order, and saw me pulling at the end, they set up such
a scream of grief and despair, that it is almost impossible to
describe or conceive. When I had got out of danger, I stopped awhile
to pick out the arrows that stuck in my hands and face, and rubbed
on some of the same ointment that was given me at my first arrival, as
I have formerly mentioned. I then took off my spectacles, and
waiting about an hour, till the tide was a little fallen, I waded
through the middle with my cargo, and arrived safe at the royal port
of Lilliput
The Emperor and his whole court stood on the shore expecting the
issue of this great adventure. They saw the ships move forward in a
large half-moon, but could not discern me, who was up to my breast
in water. When I advanced to the middle of the channel, they were
yet in more pain, because I was under water to my neck. The Emperor
concluded me to be drowned, and that the enemy's fleet was approaching
in a hostile manner: but he was soon eased of his fears, for the
channel growing shallower every step I made, I came in a short time
within hearing, and holding up the end of the cable by which the fleet
was fastened, I cried in a loud voice, Long live the most puissant
Emperor of Lilliput! This great prince received me at my landing
with all possible encomiums, and created me a Nardac upon the spot,
which is the highest title of honor among them.
His Majesty desired I would take some other opportunity of
bringing all the rest of his enemy's ships into his ports. And so
unmeasurable is the ambition of princes, that he seemed to think of
nothing less than reducing the whole empire of Blefuscu into a
province, and governing it by a Viceroy; of destroying the
Big-Endian exiles, and compelling that people to break the smaller end
of their eggs, by which he would remain the sole monarch of the
whole world. But I endeavored to divert him from this design, by
many arguments drawn from the topics of policy as well as justice; and
I plainly protested, that I would never be an instrument of bringing a
free and brave people into slavery. And when the matter was debated in
council, the wisest part of the ministry were of my opinion.
This open bold declaration of mine was so opposite to the schemes
and politics of his Imperial Majesty, that he could never forgive
it; he mentioned it in a very artful manner at council, where I was
told that some of the wisest appeared, at least by their silence, to
be of my opinion; but others, who were my secret enemies, could not
forbear some expressions, which by a side-wind reflected on me. And
from this time began an intrigue between his Majesty and a junto of
ministers maliciously bent against me, which broke out in less than
two months, and had like to have ended in my utter destruction. Of
so little weight are the greatest services to princes, when put into
the balance with a refusal to gratify their passions.
{P_1|CH_5 ^paragraph 5}
About three weeks after this exploit, there arrived a solemn embassy
from Blefuscu, with humble offers of a peace; which was soon concluded
upon conditions very advantageous to our Emperor, wherewith I shall
not trouble the reader. There were six ambassadors, with a train of
about five hundred persons, and their entry was very magnificent,
suitable to the grandeur of their master, and the importance of
their business. When their treaty was finished, wherein I did them
several good offices by the credit I now had, or at least appeared
to have at court, their Excellencies, who were privately told how much
I had been their friend, made me a visit in form. They began with many
compliments upon my valor and generosity, invited me to that kingdom
in the Emperor their master's name, and desired me to show them some
proofs of my prodigious strength, of which they had heard so many
wonders; wherein I readily obliged them, but shall not trouble the
reader with the particulars.
When I had for some time entertained their Excellencies, to their
infinite satisfaction and surprise, I desired they would do me the
honor to present my most humble respects to the Emperor their
master, the renown of whose had so justly filled the whole world
with admiration, and whose royal person I resolved to attend before
I returned to my own country: accordingly, the next time I had the
honor to see our Emperor, I desired his general license to wait on the
Blefuscudian monarch, which he was pleased to grant me, as I could
plainly perceive, in a very cold manner; but could not guess the
reason, till I had a whisper from a certain person, that Flimnap and
Bolgolam had represented my intercourse with those ambassadors as a
mark of disaffection, from which I am sure my heart was wholly free.
And this was the first time I began to conceive some imperfect idea of
courts and ministers.
It is to be observed, that these ambassadors spoke to me by an
interpreter, the languages of both empires differing as much from each
other as any two in Europe, and each nation priding itself upon the
antiquity, beauty, and energy of their own tongues, with an avowed
contempt for that of their neighbor; yet our Emperor, standing upon
the advantage he had got by the seizure of their fleet, obliged them
to deliver their credentials, and make their speech in the Lilliputian
tongue. And it must be confessed, that from the great intercourse of
trade and commerce between both realms, from the continual reception
of exiles, which is mutual among them, and from the custom in each
empire to send their young nobility and richer gentry to the other, in
order to polish themselves by seeing the world and understanding men
and manners; there are few persons of distinction, or merchants, or
seamen, who dwell in the maritime parts, but what can hold
conversation both tongues; as I found some weeks after, when I went to
pay my respects to the Emperor of Blefuscu, which in the midst of
great misfortunes, through the malice of my enemies, proved a very
happy adventure to me, as I shall relate in its proper place.
The reader may remember, that when I signed those articles upon
which I recovered my liberty, there were some which I disliked upon
account of their being too servile, neither could anything but an
extreme necessity have forced me to submit. But being now a Nardac, of
the highest rank in that empire, such offices were looked upon as
below my dignity, and the Emperor (to do him justice) never once
mentioned them to me. However, it was not long before I had an
opportunity of doing his Majesty, at least, as I then thought, a
most signal service. I was alarmed at midnight with the cries of
many hundred people at my door; by which being suddenly awaked, I
was in some kind of terror. I heard the word burglum repeated
incessantly: several of the Emperor's court, making their way
through the crowd, entreated me to come immediately to the Palace,
where her Imperial Majesty's apartment was on fire, by the
carelessness of a maid of honor, who fell asleep while she was reading
a romance. I got up in an instant; and orders being given to clear the
way before me, and it being likewise a moonshine night, I made a shift
to get to the Palace without trampling on any of the people. I found
they had already applied ladders to the walls of the apartment, and
were well provided with buckets, but the water was at some distance.
These buckets were about the size of a large thimble, and the poor
people supplied me with them as fast as they could; but the flame
was so violent that they did little good. I might easily have
stifled it with my coat, which I unfortunately left behind me for
haste, and came away only in my leathern jerkin. The case seemed
wholly desperate and deplorable; and this magnificent palace would
have infallibly been burned down to the ground, if, by a presence of
mind, unusual to me, I had not suddenly thought of an expedient. I had
the evening before drunk plentifully of a most delicious wine,
called glimigrim (the Blefuscudians call it flunec, but ours is
esteemed the better sort), which is very diuretic. By the luckiest
chance in the world, I had not discharged myself of any part of it.
The heat I had contracted by coming very near the flames, and by
laboring to quench them, made the wine begin to operate my urine;
which I voided in such a quantity, and applied so well to the proper
places, that in three minutes the fire was wholly extinguished, and
the rest of that noble pile, which had cost so many ages in
erecting, preserved from destruction.
It was now daylight, and I returned to my house without waiting to
congratulate with the Emperor: because, although I had done a very
eminent piece of service, yet I could not tell how his Majesty might
resent the manner by which I had performed it: for, by the fundamental
laws of the realm, it is capital in any person, of what quality
soever, to make water within the precincts of the palace. But I was
a little comforted by a message from his Majesty, that he would give
orders to the Grand Justiciary for passing my pardon in form; which,
however, I could not obtain. And I was privately assured, that the
Empress, conceiving the greatest abhorrence of what I had done,
removed to the most distant side of the court, firmly resolved that
those buildings should never be repaired for her use: and, in the
presence of her chief confidants could not forbear vowing revenge.

CHAPTER VI
-
Although I intend to leave the description of this empire to a
particular treatise, yet in the meantime I am content to gratify the
curious reader with some general ideas. As the common size of the
natives is somewhat under six inches high, so there is an exact
proportion in all other animals, as well as plants and trees: for
instance, the tallest horses and oxen are between four and five inches
in height, the sheep an inch and a half, more or less: their geese
about the bigness of a sparrow, and so the several gradations
downwards till you come to the smallest, which, to my sight, were
almost invisible; but nature had adapted the eyes of the
Lilliputians to all objects proper for their view: they see with great
exactness, but at no great distance. And to show the sharpness of
their sight towards objects that are near, I have been much pleased
with observing a cook pulling a lark, which was not so large as a
common fly; and a young girl threading an invisible needle with
invisible silk. Their tallest trees are about seven feet high; I
mean some of those in the great royal park, the tops whereof I could
but just reach with my fist clenched. The other vegetables are in
the same proportion; but this I leave to the reader's imagination.
I shall say but little at present of their learning, which for
many ages had flourished in all its branches among them; but their
manner of writing is very peculiar, being neither from the left to the
right, like the Europeans; nor from the right to the left, like the
Arabians; nor from up to down, like the Chinese; nor from down to
up, like the Cascagians; but aslant from one corner of the paper to
the other, like ladies in England.
They bury their dead with their heads directly downwards, because
they hold an opinion, that in eleven thousand moons they are all to
rise again, in which period the earth (which they conceive to be flat)
will turn upside down, and by this means they shall, at their
resurrection, be found ready standing on their feet. The learned among
them confess the absurdity of this doctrine, but the practice still
continues, in compliance to the vulgar.
There are some laws and customs in this empire very peculiar; and if
they were not so directly contrary to those of my own dear country,
I should be tempted to say a little in their justification. It is only
to be wished that they were as well executed. The first I shall
mention relates to informers. All crimes against the state are
punished here with the utmost severity; but if the person accused
makes his innocence plainly to appear upon his trial, the accuser is
immediately put to an ignominious death; and out of his goods or
lands, the innocent person is quadruply recompensed for the loss of
his time, for the danger he underwent, for the hardship of his
imprisonment, and for all the charges he had been at in making his
defense. Or, if that fund be deficient, it is largely supplied by
the Crown. The Emperor does also confer on him some public mark of his
favor, and proclamation is made of his innocence through the whole
city.
They look upon fraud as a greater crime than theft, and therefore
seldom fail to punish it with death; for they allege, that care and
vigilance, with a very common understanding, may preserve a man's
goods from thieves, but honesty has no fence against superior cunning;
and since it is necessary that there should be a perpetual intercourse
of buying and selling, and dealing upon credit, where fraud is
permitted and connived at, or has no law to punish it, the honest
dealer is always undone, and the knave gets the advantage. remember
when I was once interceding with the King for a criminal who had
wronged his master of a great sum of money, which he had received by
order, and ran away with; and happening to tell his Majesty, by way of
extenuation, that it was only a breach of trust; the Emperor thought
it monstrous in me to offer, as a defense, the greatest aggravation of
the crime: and truly I had little to say in return, farther than the
common answer, that different nations had different customs; for, I
confess, I was heartily ashamed.
{P_1|CH_6 ^paragraph 5}
Although we usually call reward and punishment the two hinges upon
which all government turns, yet I could never observe this maxim to be
put in practice by any nation except that of Lilliput. Whoever can
there bring sufficient proof that he has strictly observed the laws of
his country for seventy-three moons, has a claim to certain
privileges, according to his quality and condition of life, with a
proportionable sum of money out of a fund appropriated for that use:
he likewise acquires the title of Snilpall, or Legal, which is added
to his name, but does not descend to his posterity. And these people
thought it a prodigious defect of policy among us, when I told them
that our laws were enforced only by penalties without any mention of
reward. It is upon this account that the image of justice, in their
courts of judicature, is formed with six eyes, two before, as many
behind, and on each side one, to signify circumspection; with a bag of
gold open in her right hand, and a sword sheathed in her left, to show
she is more disposed to reward than to punish.
In choosing persons for all employments, they have more regard to
good morals than to great abilities; for, since government is
necessary to mankind, they believe-that the common size of human
understandings is fitted to some station or other, and that Providence
never intended to make the management of public affairs a mystery,
to be comprehended only by a few persons of sublime genius, of which
there seldom are three born in an age: but they suppose truth,
justice, temperance, and the like, to be in every man's power; the
practice of which virtues, assisted by experience and a good
intention, would qualify any man for the service of his country,
except where a course of study is required. But they thought the
want of moral virtues was so far from being supplied by superior
endowments of the mind, that employments could never be put into
such dangerous hands as those of persons so qualified; and at least,
that the mistakes committed by ignorance in a virtuous disposition,
would never be of such fatal consequence to the public weal, as the
practices of a man whose inclinations led him to be corrupt, and had
great abilities to manage, and multiply, and defend his corruptions.
In like manner, the disbelief of a Divine Providence renders a man
incapable of holding any public station; for, since kings avow
themselves to be the deputies of Providence, the Lilliputians think
nothing can be more absurd than for a prince to employ such men as
disown the authority under which he acts.
In relating these and the following laws, I would only be understood
to mean the original institutions, and not the most scandalous
corruptions into which these people are fallen by the degenerate
nature of man. For as to that infamous practice of acquiring great
employments by dancing on the ropes, or badges of favor and
distinction by leaping over sticks and creeping under them, the reader
is to observe, that they were first introduced by the grandfather of
the Emperor now reigning, and grew to the present height by the
gradual increase of party and faction.
Ingratitude is among them a capital crime, as we read it to have
been in some other countries; for they reason thus, that whoever makes
ill returns to his benefactor, must needs be a common enemy to the
rest of mankind, from whom he has received no obligation, and
therefore such a man is not fit to live.
{P_1|CH_6 ^paragraph 10}
Their notions relating to the duties of parents and children
differ extremely from ours. For since the conjunction of male and
female is founded upon the great law of nature, in order to
propagate and continue the species, the Lilliputians will needs have
it, that men and women are joined together like other animals, by
the motives of concupiscence; and that their tenderness towards
their young proceeds from the like natural principle: for which reason
they will never allow, that a child is under any obligation to his
father for begetting him, or his mother for bringing him into the
world; which, considering the miseries of human life, was neither a
benefit itself, nor intended so by his parents, whose thoughts in
their love-encounters were otherwise employed. Upon these, and the
like reasonings, their opinion is, that parents are the last of all
others to be trusted with the education of their own children: and
therefore they have in every town public nurseries, where all parents,
except cottagers and laborers, are obliged to send their infants of
both sexes to be reared and educated when they come to the age of
twenty moons, at which time they are supposed to have some rudiments
of docility. These schools are of several kinds, suited to different
qualities, and to both sexes. They have certain professors well
skilled in preparing children for such a condition of life as befits
the rank of their parents, and their own capacities as well as
inclinations. I shall say something of the male nurseries, and then of
the female.
The nurseries for males of noble or eminent birth are provided
with grave and learned professors, and their several deputies. The
clothes and food of the children are plain and simple. They are bred
up in the principles of honor, justice, courage, modesty, clemency,
religion, and love of their country; they are always employed in
some business, except in the times of eating and sleeping, which are
very short, and two hours for diversions, consisting of bodily
exercises. They are dressed by men till four years of age, and then
are obliged to dress themselves, although their quality be ever so
great; and the women attendants, who are aged proportionably to ours
at fifty, perform only the most menial offices. They are never
suffered to converse with servants, but go together in small or
greater numbers to take their diversions, and always in the presence
of a professor, or one of his deputies; whereby they avoid those early
bad impressions of folly and vice to which our children are subject.
Their parents are suffered to see them only twice a year; the visit is
to last but an hour. They are allowed to kiss the child at meeting and
parting; but a professor, who always stands by on those occasions,
will not suffer them to whisper, or use any fondling expressions, or
bring any presents of toys, sweetmeats, and the like.
The pension from each family for the education and entertainment
of a child, upon failure of due payment, is levied by the Emperor's
officers.
The nurseries for children of ordinary gentlemen, merchants,
traders, and handicrafts, are managed proportionably after the same
manner; only those designed for trades are put out apprentices at
eleven years old, whereas those of persons of quality continue in
their exercises till fifteen, which answers to one and twenty with us:
but the confinement is gradually lessened for the last three years.
In the female nurseries, the young girls of quality are educated
much like the males, only they are dressed by orderly servants of
their own sex; but always in the presence of a professor or deputy,
till they come to dress themselves, which is at five years old. And if
it be found that these nurses ever presume to entertain the girls with
frightful or foolish stories, or the common follies practiced by
chambermaids among us, they are publicly whipped thrice about the
city, imprisoned for a year and banished for life to the most desolate
part of the country. Thus the young ladies there are as much ashamed
of being cowards and fools as the men, and despise all personal
ornaments beyond decency and cleanliness: neither did I perceive any
difference in their education, made by their difference of sex, only
that the exercises of the females were not altogether so robust; and
that some rules were given them relating to domestic life, and a
smaller compass of learning was enjoined them: for their maxim is,
that among people of quality a wife should be always a reasonable
and agreeable companion, because she cannot always be young. When
the girls are twelve years old, which among them is the marriageable
age, their parents or guardians take them home, with great expressions
of gratitude to the professors, and seldom without tears of the
young lady and her companions.
{P_1|CH_6 ^paragraph 15}
In the nurseries of females of the meaner sort, the children are
instructed in all kinds of works proper for their sex, and their
several degrees: those intended for apprentices are dismissed at
nine years old, the rest are to thirteen.
The meaner families who have children at these nurseries, are
obliged, besides their annual pension, which is as low as possible, to
return to the steward of the nursery a small monthly share of their
gettings, to be a portion for the child; and therefore all parents are
limited in their expenses by the law. For the Lilliputians think
nothing can be more unjust, than for people, in subservience to
their own appetites, to bring children into the world and leave the
burden of supporting them on the public. As to persons of quality,
they give security to appropriate a certain sum for each child,
suitable to their condition; and these funds are always managed with
good husbandry, and the most exact justice.
The cottagers and laborers keep their children at home, their
business being only to till and cultivate the earth, and therefore
their education is of little consequence to the public; but the old
and discased among them are supported by hospitals: for begging is a
trade unknown in this kingdom.
And here it may perhaps divert the curious reader to give some
account of my domestics, and my manner of living in this country,
during a residence of nine months and thirteen days. Having a head
mechanically turned, and being likewise forced by necessity, I had
made for myself a table and chair convenient enough, out of the
largest trees in the royal park. Two hundred seamstresses were
employed to make me shirts, and linen for my bed and table, all of the
strongest and coarsest kind they could get; which, however, they
were forced to quilt together in several folds, for the thickest was
some degrees finer than lawn. Their linen is usually three inches
wide, and three feet make a piece. The seamstresses took my measure as
I lay on the ground, one standing at my neck, and another at my
mid-leg, with a strong cord extended, that each held by the end, while
the third measured the length of the cord with a rule an inch long.
Then they measured my right thumb, and desired no more; for by a
mathematical computation, that twice round the thumb is once round the
wrist, and so on to the neck and the waist, and by the help of my
old shirt, which I displayed on the ground before them for a
pattern, they fitted me exactly. Three hundred tailors were employed
in the same manner to make me clothes; but they had another
contrivance for taking my measure. I kneeled down, and they raised a
ladder from the ground to my neck; upon this ladder one of them
mounted, and let fall a plumb-line from my collar to the floor,
which just answered the length of my coat; but my waist and arms I
measured myself. When my clothes finished, which was done in my
house (for the largest of theirs would not have been able to hold
them) they looked like the patch-work made by the ladies in England,
only that mine were all of a color.
I had three hundred cooks to dress my victuals, in little convenient
huts built about my house, where they and their families lived, and
prepared me two dishes apiece. I took up twenty waiters in my hand,
and placed them on the table; a hundred more attended below on the
ground, some with dishes of meat, and some with barrels of wine, and
other liquors, slung on their shoulders; all which the waiters above
drew up as I wanted, in a very ingenious manner, by certain cords,
as we draw the bucket up a well in Europe. A dish of their meat was
a good mouthful, and a barrel of their liquor a reasonable draught.
Their mutton yields to ours, but their beef is excellent. I have had a
sirloin so large, that I have been forced to make three bits of it;
but this is rare. My servants were astonished to see me eat it bones
and all, as in our country we do the leg of a lark. Their geese and
turkeys I usually ate at a mouthful, and I must confess they far
exceed ours. Of their smaller fowl I could take up twenty or thirty at
the end of my knife.
{P_1|CH_6 ^paragraph 20}
One day his Imperial Majesty, being informed of my way of living,
desired that himself and his Royal Consort, with the young Princes
of the blood of both sexes, might have the happiness (as he was
pleased to call it) of dining with me. They came accordingly, and I
placed them upon chairs of state on my table, just over against me,
with their guards about them. Flimnap, the Lord High Treasurer,
attended there likewise with his white staff; and I observed he
often looked on me with a sour countenance, which I would not seem
to regard, but ate more than usual, in honor to my dear country, as
well as to fill the court with admiration. I have some private reasons
to believe, that this visit from his Majesty gave Flimnap an
opportunity of doing me ill offices to his master. That minister had
always been my secret enemy, though he outwardly caressed me more than
was usual to the moroseness of his nature. He represented to the
Emperor the low condition of his treasury; that he was forced to
take up money at great discount; that exchequer bills would not
circulate under nine per cent below par; that in short I had cost
his Majesty above a million and a half of sprugs (their greatest
gold coin, about the bigness of a spangle) and upon the whole, that it
would be advisable in the Emperor to take the first fair occasion of
dismissing me.
I am here obliged to vindicate the reputation of an excellent
lady, who was an innocent sufferer upon my account. The Treasurer took
a fancy to be jealous of his wife, from the malice of some evil
tongues, who informed him that her Grace had taken a violent affection
for my person; and the court-scandal ran for some time, that she
once came privately to my lodging. This I solemnly declare to be a
most infamous falsehood, without any grounds, farther than that her
Grace was pleased to treat me with all innocent marks of freedom and
friendship. I own she came often to my house, but always publicly, nor
ever without three more in the coach, who were usually her sister
and young daughter, and some particular acquaintance; but this was
common to many other ladies of the court. And I still appeal to my
servants round, whether they at any time saw a coach at my door
without knowing what persons were in it. On those occasions, when a
servant had given me notice, my custom was to go immediately to the
door; and, after paying my respects, to take up the coach and two
horses very carefully in my hands (for if there were six horses, the
postillion always unharnessed four) and place them on a table, where I
had fixed a moveable rim quite round, of five inches high, to
prevent accidents. And I have often had four coaches and horses at
once on my table full of company, while I sat in my chair leaning my
face towards them; and when I was engaged with one set, the coachmen
would gently drive the others round my table. I have passed many an
afternoon very agreeably in these conversations. But I defy the
Treasurer, or his two informers (I will name them, and let them make
their best of it) Clustril and Drunlo, to prove that any person ever
came to me incognito, except the secretary Reldresal, who was sent
by express command of his Imperial Majesty, as I have before
related. I should not have dwelt so long upon this particular, it
had not been a point wherein the reputation of a great lady is so
nearly concerned, to say nothing of my own; though I then had the
honor to be a Nardac, which the Treasurer himself is not; for all
the world knows he is only a Glumglum, a title inferior by one degree,
as that of a Marquis is to a Duke in England, although I allow he
preceded me in right of his post. These false informations, which I
afterwards came to the knowledge of, by an accident not proper to
mention, made Flimnap the Treasurer show his lady for some time an ill
countenance, and me a worse; and although he were at last undeceived
and reconciled to her, yet I lost all credit with him, and found my
interest decline very fast with the Emperor himself, who was indeed
too much governed by that favorite.

CHAPTER VII
-
Before I proceed to give an account of my leaving this kingdom, it
may be proper to inform the reader of a private intrigue which had
been for two months forming against me.
I had been hitherto all my life a stranger to courts, for which I
was unqualified by the meanness of my condition. I had indeed heard
and read enough of the dispositions of great princes and ministers;
but never expected to have found such terrible effects of them in so
remote a country, governed, as I thought, by very different maxims
from those in Europe.
When I was just preparing to pay my attendance on the Emperor of
Blefuscu, a considerable person at court (to whom I had been very
serviceable at a time when he lay under the highest displeasure of his
Imperial Majesty) came to my house very privately at night in a
close chair, and without sending his name, desired admittance. The
chairmen were dismissed; I put the chair, with his Lordship in it,
into my coat-pocket: and giving orders to a trusty servant to say I
was indisposed and gone to sleep, I fastened the door of my house,
placed the chair on the table, according to my usual custom, and sat
down by it. After the common salutations were over, observing his
Lordship's countenance full of concern, and enquiring into the reason,
he desired I would hear him with patience in a matter that highly
concerned my honor and my life. His speech was to the following
effect, for I took notes of it as soon as he left me.
You are to know, said he, that several Committees of Council have
been lately called in the most private manner on your account; and
it is but two days since his Majesty came to a full resolution.
You are very sensible that Skyresh Bolgolam (Galbet, or High
Admiral) has been your mortal enemy almost ever since your arrival.
His original reasons I know not, but his hatred is much increased
since your great success against Blefuscu, by which his glory as
Admiral is obscured. This Lord, in conjunction with Flimnap the High
Treasurer, whose enmity against you is notorious on account of his
lady, Limtoc the General, Lalcon the Chamberlain, and Balmuff the
Grand Justiciary, have prepared articles of impeachment against you,
for treason, and other capital crimes.
{P_1|CH_7 ^paragraph 5}
This preface made me so impatient, being conscious of my own
merits and innocence, that I was going to interrupt; when he entreated
me to be silent, and thus proceeded.
Out of gratitude for the favors you have done me, I procured
information of the whole proceedings, and a copy of the articles,
wherein I venture my head for your service.
-
Articles of Impeachment against Quinbus Flestrin
(the Man-Mountain)
{P_1|CH_7 ^paragraph 10}
-
ARTICLE I
Whereas, by a statute made in the reign of his Imperial Majesty
Calin Deffar Plune, it is enacted, that whoever shall make water
within the precincts of the royal palace, should be liable to the
pains and penalties of high treason; notwithstanding, the said Quinbus
Flestrin, in open breach of the said law, under color of extinguishing
the fire kindled in the apartment of his Majesty's most dear
Imperial Consort, did maliciously, traitorously, and devilishly, by
discharge of his urine, put out the said fire kindled in the said
apartment, lying and being within the precincts of the said royal
palace, against the statute in that case provided, etc., against the
duty, etc.
-
ARTICLE II.
{P_1|CH_7 ^paragraph 15}
That the said Quinbus Flestrin having brought the imperial fleet
of Blefuscu into the royal port, and being afterwards commanded by his
Imperial Majesty to seize all the other ships of the said empire of
Blefuscu, and reduce that empire to a province, to be governed by a
Viceroy from hence, and to destroy and put to death not only all the
Big-Endian exiles, but likewise all the people of that empire, who
would not immediately forsake the Big-Endian heresy: He, the said
Flestrin, like a false traitor against his most Auspicious, Serene,
Imperial Majesty, did petition to be excused from the said service
upon pretense of unwillingness to force the consciences, or destroy
the liberties and lives of an innocent people.
-
ARTICLE III.
That, whereas certain ambassadors from the court of Blefuscu, to sue
for peace in his Majesty's court: He, the said Flestrin, did, like a
false traitor, aid, abet, comfort, and divert the said ambassadors,
although he knew them to be servants to a Prince who was lately an
open enemy to his Imperial Majesty, and in open war against his said
Majesty.
-
{P_1|CH_7 ^paragraph 20}
ARTICLE IV.
That the said Quinbus Flestrin, contrary to the duty of a faithful
subject, is now preparing to make a voyage to the court and empire
of Blefuscu, for which he had received only verbal license from his
Imperial Majesty; and under color of the said license, doth falsely
and traitorously intend to take the said voyage, and hereby to aid,
comfort, and abet the Emperor of Blefuscu, so late an enemy, and in
open war with his Imperial Majesty aforesaid.
-
There are some other articles, but these are the most important,
of which I have read you an abstract.
In the several debates upon this impeachment, it must be confessed
that his Majesty gave many marks of his great lenity, often urging the
services you had done him, and endeavoring to extenuate your crimes.
The Treasurer and Admiral insisted that you should be put to the
most painful and ignominious death, by setting fire on your house at
night, and the General was to attend with twenty thousand men armed
with poisoned arrows to shoot you on the face and hands. Some of
your servants were to have private orders to strew a poisonous juice
on your shirts, which would soon make you tear your own flesh, and die
in the utmost torture. The General came into the same opinion, so that
for a long time there was a majority against you. But his Majesty
resolving, if possible, to spare your life, at last brought off the
Chamberlain.
{P_1|CH_7 ^paragraph 25}
Upon this incident, Reldresal, principal Secretary for Private
Affairs, who always approved himself your true friend, was commanded
by the Emperor to deliver his opinion, which he accordingly did; and
therein justified the good thoughts you have of him. He allowed your
crimes to be great, but that still there was room for mercy, the
most commendable virtue in a prince, and for which his Majesty was
so justly celebrated. He said, the friendship between you and him
was so well known to the world, that perhaps the most honorable
board might think him partial: however, in obedience to the command he
had received, he would freely offer his sentiments. That if his
Majesty, in consideration of your services, and pursuant to his own
merciful disposition, would please to spare your life, and only give
order to put out both your eyes, he humbly conceived that by this
expedient justice might in some measure be satisfied, and all the
world would applaud the lenity of the Emperor, as well as the fair and
generous proceedings of those who have the honor to be his
counsellors. That the loss of your eyes would be no impediment to your
bodily strength, by which you might still be useful to his Majesty.
That blindness is an addition to courage, by concealing dangers from
us; that the fear you had for your eyes was the greatest difficulty in
bringing over the enemy's fleet, and it would be sufficient for you to
see by the eyes of the ministers, since the greatest princes do no
more.
This proposal was received with the utmost disapprobation by the
whole board. Bolgolam, the Admiral, could not preserve his temper, but
rising up in fury said he wondered how the Secretary dared presume
to give his opinion for preserving the life of a traitor: that the
services you had performed, were, by all true reasons of state, the
great aggravation of your crimes; that you, who were able to
extinguish the fire, by discharge of urine in her Majesty's
apartment (which he mentioned with horror), might at another time,
raise an inundation by the same means, to drown the whole palace;
and the same strength which enabled you to bring over the enemy's
fleet, might serve, upon the first discontent, to carry it back:
that he had good reasons to think you were a Big-Endian in your heart;
and as treason begins in the heart, before it appears in overt acts,
so he accused you as a traitor on that account, and therefore insisted
you should be put to death.
The Treasurer was of the same opinion; he showed to what straits his
Majesty's revenue was reduced by the charge of maintaining you,
which would soon grow insupportable: that the Secretary's expedient of
putting out your eyes was so far from being a remedy against this
evil, it would probably increase it, as it is manifest from the common
practice of blinding some kind of fowl, after which they fed the
faster, and grew sooner fat: that his sacred Majesty and the
Council, who are your judges, were in their own consciences fully
convinced of your guilt, which was a sufficient argument to condemn
you to death, without the formal proofs required by the strict
letter of the law.
But his Imperial Majesty, fully determined against capital
punishment, was graciously pleased to say, that since the Council
thought the loss of your eyes too easy a censure, some other may be
inflicted hereafter. And your friend the Secretary humbly desiring
to be heard again, in answer to what the Treasurer had objected
concerning the great charge his Majesty was at in maintaining you,
said that his Excellency, who had the sole disposal of the Emperor's
revenue, might easily provide against that evil, by gradually
lessening your establishment; by which, for want of sufficient food,
you would grow weak and faint, and lose your appetite, and
consequently decay and consume in a few months; neither would the
stench of your carcass be then so dangerous, when it should become
more than half diminished; and immediately upon your death, five or
six thousand of his Majesty's subjects might, in two or three days,
cut your flesh from your bones, take it away by cartloads, and bury it
in distant parts to prevent infection, leaving the skeleton as a
monument of admiration to posterity.
Thus by the great friendship of the Secretary, the whole affair
was compromised. It was strictly enjoined, that the project of
starving you by degrees should be kept a secret, but the sentence of
putting out your eyes was entered on the books; none dissenting except
Bolgolam the Admiral, who, being a creature of the Empress, was
perpetually instigated by her Majesty to insist upon your death, she
having borne perpetual malice against you, on account of that infamous
and illegal method you took to extinguish the fire in her apartment.
{P_1|CH_7 ^paragraph 30}
In three days your friend the Secretary will be directed to come
to your house, and read before you the articles of impeachment; and
then to signify the great lenity and favor of his Majesty and Council,
whereby you are only condemned to the loss of your eyes, which his
Majesty does not question you will gratefully and humbly submit to;
and twenty of his Majesty's surgeons will attend, in order to see
the operation well performed, by discharging very sharp-pointed arrows
into the balls of your eyes, as you lie on the ground.
I leave to your prudence what measures you will take; and to avoid
suspicion, I must immediately return in as private a manner as I came.
His Lordship did so, and I remained alone, under many doubts and
perplexities of mind.
It was a custom introduced by this prince and his ministry (very
different, as I have been assured, from the practices of former times)
that after the court had decreed any cruel execution, either to
gratify the monarch's resentment, or the malice of a favorite, the
Emperor always made a speech to his whole Council, expressing his
great lenity and tenderness, as qualities known and confessed by all
the world. This speech was immediately published through the
kingdom; nor did anything terrify the people so much as those
encomiums on his Majesty's mercy; because it was observed, that the
more these praises were enlarged and insisted on, the more inhuman was
the punishment, and the sufferer more innocent. And as to myself, I
must confess, having never been designed for a courtier either by my
birth or education, I was so ill a judge of things, that I could not
discover the lenity and favor of this sentence, but conceived it
(perhaps erroneously) rather to be rigorous than gentle. I sometimes
thought of standing my trial, for although I could not deny the
facts alleged in the several articles, yet I hoped they would admit of
some extenuations. But having in my life perused many state trials,
which I ever observed to terminate as the judges thought fit to
direct, I dared not rely on so dangerous a decision, in so critical
a juncture, and against such powerful enemies. Once I was strongly
bent upon resistance, for while I had liberty, the whole strength of
that empire could hardly subdue me, and I might easily with stones
pelt the metropolis to pieces; but I soon rejected that project with
horror, by remembering the oath I had made to the Emperor, the
favors I received from him, and the high title of Nardac he
conferred upon me. Neither had I so soon learned the gratitude of
courtiers, to persuade myself that his Majesty's present severities
quitted me of all past obligations.
At last I fixed upon a resolution, for which it is probable I may
incur some censure, and not unjustly; for I confess I owe the
preserving of my eyes, and consequently my liberty, to my own great
rashness and want of experience: because if I had then known the
nature of princes and ministers, which I have since observed in many
other courts, and their methods of treating criminals less obnoxious
than myself, I should with great alacrity and readiness have submitted
to so easy a punishment. But hurried on by the precipitancy of
youth, and having his Imperial Majesty's license to pay my
attendance upon the Emperor of Blefuscu, I took this opportunity,
before the three days were elapsed, to send a letter to my friend
the Secretary, signifying my resolution of setting out that morning
Blefuscu pursuant to the leave I had got; and without waiting for an
answer, I went to that side of the island where our fleet lay. I
seized a large man of war, tied a cable to the prow, and, lifting up
the anchors, I stripped myself, put my clothes (together with my
coverlet, which I brought under my arm) into the vessel, and drawing
it after me between wading and swimming, arrived at the royal port
of Blefuscu, where the people had long expected me; they lent me two
guides to direct me to the capital city, which is of the same name.
I held them in my hands till I came within two hundred yards of the
gate, and desired them to signify my arrival to one of the
secretaries, and let him know, I there waited his Majesty's
commands. I had an answer in about an hour, that his Majesty, attended
by the Royal Family, and great officers of the court, was coming out
to receive me. I advanced a hundred yards. The Emperor and his train
alighted from their horses, the Empress and ladies from their coaches,
and I did not perceive they were in any fright or concern. I lay on
the ground to kiss his Majesty's and the Empress's hand. I told his
Majesty that I had come according to my promise, and with the
license of the Emperor, my master, to have the honor of seeing so
mighty a monarch, and to offer him any service in my power, consistent
with my duty to my own prince; not mentioning a word of my disgrace,
because I had hitherto no regular information of it, and might suppose
myself wholly ignorant of any such design; neither could I
reasonably conceive that the Emperor would discover the secret while I
was out of his power: wherein, however, it soon appeared I was
deceived.
{P_1|CH_7 ^paragraph 35}
I shall not trouble the reader with the particular account of my
reception at this court, which was suitable to the generosity of so
great a prince; nor of the difficulties I was in for want of a house
and bed, being forced to lie on the ground, wrapped up in my coverlet.

P_1|CH_8
CHAPTER VIII
-
Three days after my arrival, walking out of curiosity to the
northeast coast of the island, I observed, about half a league off, in
the sea, something that looked like a boat overturned. I pulled off my
shoes and stockings, and wading two or three hundred yards, I found
the object to approach nearer by force of the tide; and then plainly
saw it to be a real boat, which I supposed might, by some tempest,
have been driven from a ship; whereupon I returned immediately towards
the city, and desired his Imperial Majesty to lend me twenty of the
tallest vessels he had left after the loss of his fleet, and three
thousand seamen under the command of his Vice-Admiral. This fleet
sailed round, while I went back the shortest way to the coast where
I first discovered the boat; I found the tide had driven it still
nearer. The seamen were all provided with cordage, which I had
beforehand twisted to a sufficient strength. When the ships came up, I
stripped myself, and waded till I came within a hundred yards of the
boat, after which I was forced to swim till I got up to it. The seamen
threw me the end of the cord, which I fastened to a hole in the
forepart of the boat, and the other end to a man of war; but I found
all my labor to little purpose; for being out of my depth, I was not
able to work. In this necessity, I was forced to swim behind, and push
the boat forwards as often as I could, with one of my hands; and the
tide favoring me, I advanced so far, that I could just hold up my chin
and feel the ground. I rested two or three minutes, and then gave
the boat another shove, and so on till the sea was no higher than my
arm-pits; and now the most laborious part being over, I took out my
other cables, which were stowed in one of the ships, and fastening
them first to the boat, and then to nine of the vessels which attended
me; the wind being favorable, the seamen towed, and I shoved till we
arrived within forty yards of the shore; and waiting till the tide was
out, I got dry to the boat, and by the assistance of two thousand men,
with ropes and engines, I made a shift to turn it on its bottom, and
found it was but little damaged.
I shall not trouble the reader with the difficulties I was under
by the help of certain paddles, which cost me ten days making, to
get my boat to the royal port of Blefuscu, where a mighty concourse of
people appeared upon my arrival, full of wonder at the sight of so
prodigious a vessel. I told the Emperor that my good fortune had
thrown this boat in my way, to carry me to some place from whence I
might return into my native country, and begged his Majesty's orders
for getting materials to fit it up, together with his license to
depart; which, after some kind expostulations, he was pleased to
grant.
I did very much wonder, in all this time, not to have heard of any
express relating to me from our Emperor to the court of Blefuscu.
But I was afterwards given privately to understand, that his
Imperial Majesty, never imagining I had the least notice of his
designs, believed I was only gone to Blefuscu in performance of my
promise, according to the license he had given me, which was well
known at our court, and would return in a few days when that
ceremony was ended. But he was at last in pain at my long absence; and
after consulting with the Treasurer, and the rest of that cabal, a
person of quality was dispatched with the copy of the articles against
me. This envoy had instructions to represent to the monarch of
Blefuscu the great lenity of his master, who was content to punish
me no farther than with the loss of my eyes; that I had fled from
justice, and if I did not return in two hours, I should be deprived of
my title of Nardac, and declared a traitor. The envoy further added,
that in order to maintain the peace and amity between both empires,
his master expected, that his brother of Blefuscu would give orders to
have me sent back to Lilliput, bound hand and foot, to be punished
as a traitor.
The Emperor of Blefuscu having taken three days to consult, returned
an answer consisting of many civilities and excuses. He said, that
as for sending me bound, his brother knew it was impossible; that
although I had deprived him of his fleet, yet he owed great
obligations to me for many good offices I had done him in making the
peace. That however both their Majesties would soon be made easy;
for I had found a prodigious vessel on the shore, able to carry me
on the sea, which he had given order to fit up with my own
assistance and direction; and he hoped in a few weeks both empires
would be freed from so insupportable an incumbrance.
With this answer the envoy returned to Lilliput, and the monarch
of Blefuscu related to me all that had past, offering me at the same
time (but under the strictest confidence) his gracious protection,
if I would continue in his service; wherein although I believed him
sincere, yet I resolved never more to put any confidence in princes or
ministers, where I could possibly avoid it; and therefore, with all
due acknowledgements for his favorable intentions, I humbly begged
to be excused. I told him that since fortune, whether good or evil,
had thrown a vessel in my way, I was resolved to venture myself in the
ocean, rather than be an occasion of difference between two such
mighty monarchs. Neither did I find the Emperor at all displeased; and
I discovered by a certain accident, that he was very glad of my
resolution, and so were most of his ministers.
{P_1|CH_8 ^paragraph 5}
These considerations moved me to hasten my departure somewhat sooner
than I intended; to which the court, impatient to have me gone, very
readily contributed. Five hundred workmen were employed to make two
sails to my boat, according to my directions, by quilting thirteen
fold of their strongest linen together. I was at the pains of making
ropes and cables, by twisting ten, twenty or thirty of the thickest
and strongest of theirs. A great stone that I happened to find,
after a long search, by the sea-shore, served me for an anchor. I
had the tallow of three hundred cows for greasing my boat, and other
uses. I was at incredible pains in cutting down some of the largest
timber-trees for oars and masts, wherein I was, however, much assisted
by his Majesty's ship carpenters, who helped me in smoothing them,
after I had done the rough work.
In about a month, when all was prepared, I sent to receive his
Majesty's commands, and to take my leave. The Emperor and Royal Family
came out of the palace; I lay down on my face to kiss his hand,
which he very graciously gave me: so did the Empress and young Princes
of the blood. His Majesty presented me with fifty purses of two
hundred sprugs apiece, together with his picture at full length, which
I put immediately into one of my gloves, to keep it from being hurt.
The ceremonies at my departure were too many to trouble the reader
with at this time.
I stored the boat with the carcases of a hundred oxen, and three
hundred sheep, with bread and drink proportionable, and as much meat
ready dressed as four hundred cooks could provide. I took with me
six cows and two bulls alive, with as many ewes and rams, intending to
carry them into my own country, and propagate the breed. And to feed
them on board, I had a good bundle of hay, and a bag of corn. I
would gladly have taken a dozen of the natives, but this was a thing
the Emperor would by no means permit; and besides a diligent search
into my pockets, his Majesty engaged my honor not to carry away any of
his subjects, although with their own consent and desire.
Having thus prepared all things as well as I was able, I set sail on
the twenty-fourth day of September, 1701, at six in the morning; and
when I had gone about four leagues to the northward, the wind being at
southeast, at six in the evening I descried a small island about
half a league to the northwest. I advanced forward, and cast anchor on
the leeside of the island, which seemed to be uninhabited. I then took
some refreshment, and went to my rest. I slept well, and I
conjecture at least six hours, for I found the day broke in two
hours after I awaked. It was a clear night. I ate my breakfast
before the sun was up; and heaving anchor, the wind being favorable, I
steered the same course that I had done the day before, wherein I
was directed by my pocket compass. My intention was to reach, if
possible, one of those islands, which I had reason to believe lay to
the northeast of Van Diemen's Land. I discovered nothing all that day;
but upon the next, about three in the afternoon, when I had by my
computation made twenty-four leagues from Blefuscu, I descried a
sail steering to the southeast; my course was due east. I hailed
her, but could get no answer; yet I found I gained upon her, for the
wind slackened. I made all the sail I could, and in half an hour she
spied me, then hung out her ancient, and discharged a gun. It is not
easy to express the joy I was in upon the unexpected hope of once more
seeing my beloved country, and the dear pledges I had left in it.
The ship slackened her sails, and I came up with her between five
and six in the evening, September 26; but my heart leaped within me to
see her English colors. I put my cows and sheep into my coat
pockets, and got on board with all my little cargo of provisions.
The vessel was an English merchantman, returning from Japan by the
North and South Seas; the Captain, Mr. John Biddle of Deptford, a very
civil man, and an excellent sailor. We were now in the latitude of
30 degrees south; there were about fifty men in the ship; and here I
met an old comrade of mine, one Peter Williams, who gave me a good
character to the Captain. This gentleman treated me with kindness, and
desired I would let know what place I came from last, and whither I
was bound; which I did in few words, but he thought I was raving,
and that the dangers I underwent had disturbed my head; whereupon I
took my black cattle and sheep out of my pocket, which, after great
astonishment, clearly convinced him of my veracity. I then showed
him the gold given me by the Emperor of Blefuscu, together with his
Majesty's picture at full length, and some other rarities of that
country. I gave him two purses of two hundred sprugs each, and
promised, when we arrived in England, to make him a present of a cow
and a sheep big with young.
I shall not trouble the reader with a particular account of this
voyage, which was very prosperous for the most part. We arrived in the
Downs on the 13th of April, 1702. I had only one misfortune, that
the rats on board carried away one of my sheep; I found her bones in a
hole, picked clean from the flesh. The rest of my cattle I got safe on
shore, and set them grazing in a bowling-green at Greenwich, where the
fineness of the grass made them feed very heartily, though I had
always feared the contrary: neither could I possibly have preserved
them in so long a voyage, if the Captain had not allowed me some of
his best biscuit, which, rubbed to powder, and mingled with water, was
their constant food. The short time I continued in England, I made
considerable profit by showing my cattle to many persons of quality,
and others: and before I began my second voyage, I sold them for six
hundred pounds. Since my last return, I find the breed is considerably
increased, especially the sheep; which I hope will prove much to the
advantage of the woollen manufacture, by the fineness of the fleeces.
{P_1|CH_8 ^paragraph 10}
I stayed but two months with my wife and family; for my insatiable
desire of seeing foreign countries would suffer me to continue no
longer. I left fifteen hundred pounds with my wife, and fixed her in a
good house at Redriff. My remaining stock I carried with me, part in
money, and part in goods, in hopes to improve my fortunes. My eldest
uncle John had left me an estate in land, near Epping, of about thirty
pounds a year; and I had a long lease of the Black Bull in Fetter
Lane, which yielded me as much more; so that I was not in any danger
of leaving my family upon the parish. My son Johnny, named so after
his uncle, was at the Grammar School, and a towardly child. My
daughter Betty (who is now well married, and has children) was then at
her needlework. I took leave of my wife, and boy and girl, with
tears on both sides, and went on board the Adventure, a merchantship
of three hundred tons, bound for Surat, Captain John Nicholas of
Liverpool, Commander. But my account of this voyage must be referred
to the second part of my Travels.

A VOYAGE TO BROBDINGNAG


(SEE PLATE 2)

P_2|CH_1
CHAPTER I
-
Having been condemned by nature and fortune to an active and
restless life, in two months after my return I again left my native
country, and took shipping in the Downs on the 20th day of June, 1702,
in the Adventure, Captain John Nicholas, a Cornishman, Commander,
bound for Surat. We had a very prosperous gale till we arrived at
the Cape of Good Hope, where we landed for fresh water, but
discovering a leak we unshipped our goods and wintered there; for
the Captain falling sick of an ague, we could not leave the Cape
till the end of March. We then set sail, and had a good voyage till we
passed the Straits of Madagascar; but having got northward of that
island, and to about five degrees south latitude, the winds, which
in those seas are observed to blow a constant equal gale between the
north and west from the beginning of December to the beginning of May,
on the 19th of April began to blow with much greater violence, and
more westerly than usual, continuing so for twenty days together,
during which time we were driven a little to the east of the Molucca
Islands, and about three degrees northward of the Line, as our Captain
found by an observation he took the 2nd of May, at which time the wind
ceased, and it was a perfect calm, whereat I was not a little
rejoiced. But he, being a man well experienced in the navigation of
those seas, bid us all prepare against a storm, which accordingly
happened the day following: for a southern wind, called the southern
monsoon, began to set in.
Finding it was likely to overblow, we took in our spritsail, and
stood by to hand the foresail; but making foul weather, we looked
the guns were all fast, and handed the mizzen. The ship lay very broad
off, so we thought it better spooning before the sea, than trying or
hulling. We reefed the foresail and set him, we hauled aft the
foresheet; the helm was hard aweather. The ship wore bravely. We
belayed the fore-down-haul; but the sail was split, and we hauled down
the yard, and got the sail into the ship, and unbound all the things
clear of it. It was a very fierce storm; the sea broke strange and
dangerous. We hauled off upon the lanyard of the whipstaff, and helped
the man at helm. We would not get down our topmast, but let all stand,
because she scudded before the sea very well, and we knew that the
topmast being aloft, the ship was the wholesomer, and made better
way through the sea, seeing we had sea room. When the storm was
over, we set foresail and mainsail, and brought the ship to: then we
set the mizzen, main-topsail, and the fore-topsail. Our course was
east northeast, the wind was at southwest. We got the starboard
tacks aboard; we cast off our weather-braces and lifts; we set in
the leebraces, and hauled forward by the weatherbowlings, and hauled
them tight, and belayed them, and hauled over the mizzen tack to
windward, and kept her full and by as near as she would lie.
During this storm, which was followed by a strong wind west
southwest, we were carried by my computation about five hundred
leagues to the east, so that the oldest sailor on board could not tell
in what part of the world we were. Our provisions held out well, our
ship was staunch, and our crew all in good health; but we lay in the
utmost distress for water. We thought it best to hold on the same
course, rather than turn more northerly, which might have brought us
to the northwest parts of Great Tartary, and into the frozen sea.
On the 16th day of June, 1703, a boy on the topmost discovered land.
On the 17th we came in full view of a great island or continent (for
we knew not which) on the south side whereof was a small neck of
land jutting out into the sea, and a creek too shallow to hold a
ship of above one hundred tons. We cast anchor within a league of this
creek, and our Captain sent a dozen of his men well armed in the
longboat, with vessels for water if any could be found. I desired
his leave to go with them, that I might see the country, and make what
discoveries I could. When we came to land we saw no river or spring,
nor any sign of inhabitants. Our men therefore wandered on the shore
to find out some fresh water near the sea, and I walked alone about
a mile on the other side, where I observed the country all barren
and rocky. I now began to be weary, and seeing nothing to entertain my
curiosity, I returned gently down towards the creek; and the sea being
full in my view, I saw our men already got into the boat, and rowing
for life to the ship. I was going to halloo after them, although it
had been to little purpose, when I observed a huge creature walking
after them in the sea, as fast as he could: he waded not much deeper
than his knees, and took prodigious strides: but our men had the start
of him half a league, and the sea thereabouts being full of
sharp-pointed rocks, the monster was not able to overtake the boat.
This I was afterwards told, for I dared not stay to see the issue of
that adventure; but ran as fast as I could the way I first went, and
then climbed up a steep hill, which gave me some prospect of the
country. I found it fully cultivated; but that which first surprised
me was the length of the grass, which in those grounds that seemed
to be kept for hay, was about twenty feet high.
I fell into a high road, for so I took it to be, though it served to
the inhabitants only as a footpath through a field of barley. Here I
walked on for some time, but could see little on either side, it being
now near harvest, and the corn rising at least forty feet. I was an
hour walking to the end of this field, which was fenced in with a
hedge of at least one hundred and twenty feet high, and the trees so
lofty that I could make no computation of their altitude. There was
a stile to pass from this field into the next. It had four steps,
and a stone to cross over when you came to the uppermost. It was
impossible for me to climb this stile, because every step was six feet
high, and the upper stone above twenty. I was endeavoring to find some
gap in the hedge, when I discovered one of the inhabitants in the next
field, advancing towards the stile, of the same size with him whom I
saw in the sea pursuing our boat. He appeared as tall as an ordinary
spire steeple, and took about ten yards at every stride, as near as
I could guess. I was struck with the utmost fear and astonishment, and
ran to hide myself in the corn, from whence I saw him at the top of
the stile, looking back into the next field on the right hand, and
heard him call in a voice many degrees louder than a speaking trumpet:
but the noise was so high in the air, that at first I certainly
thought it was thunder. Whereupon seven monsters like himself came
towards him with reaping hooks in their hands, each hook about the
size of six scythes. These people were not so well clad as the
first, whose servants or laborers they seemed to be. For upon some
words he spoke, they went to reap the corn in the field where I lay. I
kept from them at as great a distance as I could, but was forced to
move with extreme difficulty, for the stalks of the corn were
sometimes not above a foot distant, so that I could hardly squeeze
my body between them. However, I made a shift to go forward till I
came to a part of the field where the corn had been laid by the rain
and wind. Here it was impossible for me to advance a step; for the
stalks were so interwoven that I could not creep through, and the
beards of the fallen ears so strong and pointed that they pierced
through my clothes into my flesh. At the same time I heard the reapers
not above a hundred yards behind me. Being quite dispirited with toil,
and wholly overcome by grief and despair, I lay down between two
ridges, and heartily wished I might there end my days. I bemoaned my
desolate widow, and fatherless children. I lamented my own folly and
willfulness in attempting a second voyage against the advice of all my
friends and relations. In this terrible agitation of mind I could
not forbear thinking of Lilliput, whose inhabitants looked upon me
as the greatest prodigy that ever appeared in the world; where I was
able to draw an Imperial Fleet in my hand, and perform those other
actions which will be recorded forever in the chronicles of that
empire, while posterity shall hardly believe them, although attested
by millions. I reflected what a mortification it must prove to me to
appear as inconsiderable in this nation as one single Lilliputian
would be among us. But this I conceived was to be the least of my
misfortunes: for as human creatures are observed to be more savage and
cruel in proportion to their bulk, what could I expect but to be a
morsel in the mouth of the first among these enormous barbarians
that should happen to seize me? Undoubtedly philosophers are in the
right when they tell us, that nothing is great or little otherwise
than by comparison. It might have pleased fortune to let the
Lilliputians find some nation, where the people were as diminutive
with respect to them, as they were to me. And who knows but that
even this prodigious race of mortals might be equally overmatched in
some distant part of the world, whereof we have yet no discovery?
{P_2|CH_1 ^paragraph 5}
Scared and confounded as I was, I could not forbear going on with
these reflections, when one of the reapers approaching within ten
yards of the ridge where I lay, made me apprehend that with the next
step I should be squashed to death under his foot, or cut in two
with his reaping hook. And therefore when he was again about to
move, I screamed as loud as fear could make me. Whereupon the huge
creature trod short, and looking round about under him for some
time, at last espied me as I lay on the ground. He considered a
while with the caution of one who endeavors to lay hold on a small
dangerous animal in such a manner that it shall not be able either
to scratch or to bite him, as I myself have sometimes done with a
weasel in England. At length he ventured to take me up behind by the
middle between his forefinger and thumb, and brought me within three
yards of his eyes, that he might behold my shape more perfectly. I
guessed his meaning, and my good fortune gave me so much presence of
mind, that I resolved not to struggle in the least as he held me in
the air about sixty feet from the ground, although he grievously
pinched my sides, for fear I should slip through his fingers. All I
ventured was to raise my eyes towards the sun, and place my hands
together in a supplicating posture, and to speak some words in a
humble melancholy tone, suitable to the condition I then was in. For I
apprehended every moment that he would dash me against the ground,
as we usually do any little hateful animal which we have a mind to
destroy. But my good star would have it, that he appeared pleased with
my voice and gestures, and began to look upon me as a curiosity,
much wondering to hear me pronounce articulate words, although he
could not understand them. In the meantime I was not able to forbear
groaning and shedding tears, and turning my head towards my sides;
letting him know, as well as I could, how cruelly I was hurt by the
pressure of his thumb and finger. He seemed to apprehend my meaning;
for, lifting up the lappet of his coat, he put me gently into it,
and immediately ran along with me to his master, who was a substantial
farmer, and the same person I had first seen in the field.
The farmer having (as I supposed by their talk) received such an
account of me as his servant could give him, took a piece of a small
straw, about the size of a walking staff, and therewith lifted up
the lappets of my coat; which it seems he thought to be some kind of
covering that nature had given me. He blew my hair aside to take a
better view of my face. He called his hinds about him, and asked
them (as I afterwards learned) whether they had ever seen in the
fields any little creature that resembled me. He then placed me softly
on the ground upon all four, but I got immediately up, and walked
slowly backwards and forwards, to let those people see I had no intent
to run away. They all sat down in a circle about me, the better to
observe my motions. I pulled off my hat, and made a low bow towards
the farmer. I fell on my knees, and lifted up my hands and eyes, and
spoke several words as loud as I could: I took a purse of gold out
of my pocket, and humbly presented it to him. He received it on the
palm of his hand, then applied it close to his eye, to see what it
was, and afterwards turned it several times with the point of a pin
(which he took out of his sleeve), but could make nothing of it.
Whereupon I made a sign that he should place his hand on the ground. I
took the purse, and opening it, poured all the gold into his palm.
There were six Spanish pieces of four pistoles each, beside twenty
or thirty smaller coins. I saw him wet the tip of his little finger
upon his tongue, and take up one of my largest pieces, and then
another, but he seemed to be wholly ignorant what they were. He made
me a sign to put them again into my purse, and the purse again into my
pocket, which after offering to him several times, I thought it best
to do.
The farmer by this time was convinced I must be a rational creature.
He spoke often to me, but the sound of his voice pierced my ears
like that of a water mill, yet his words were articulate enough. I
answered as loud as I could, in several languages, and he often laid
his car within two yards of me, but all in vain, for we were wholly
unintelligible to each other. He then sent his servants to their work,
and taking his handkerchief out of his pocket, he doubled and spread
it on his left hand, which he placed flat on the ground, with the palm
upwards, making me a sign to step into it, as I could easily do, for
it was not above a foot in thickness. I thought it my part to obey,
and for fear of falling, laid myself at length upon the
handkerchief, with the remainder of which he lapped me up to the
head for further security, and in this manner carried me home to his
house. There he called his wife, and showed me to her; but she
screamed and ran back, as women in England do at the sight of a toad
or a spider. However, when she had a while seen my behavior, and how
well I observed the signs her husband made, she was soon reconciled,
and by degrees grew extremely tender of me.
It was about twelve at noon, and a servant brought in dinner. It was
only one substantial dish of meat (fit for the plain condition of an
husbandman) in a dish of about twenty-four feet in diameter. The
company were the farmer and his wife, three children, and an old
grandmother. When they sat down, the farmer placed me at some distance
from him on the table, which was thirty feet high from the floor. I
was in a terrible fright, and kept as far as I could from the edge for
fear of falling. The wife minced a bit of meat, then crumbled some
bread on a trencher, and placed it before me. I made her a low bow,
took out my knife and fork, and fell to eating, which gave them
exceeding delight. The mistress sent her maid for a small dram cup,
which held about three gallons, and filled it with drink; I took up
the vessel with much difficulty in both hands, and in a most
respectful manner drank to her ladyship's health, expressing the words
as loud as I could in English, which made the company laugh so
heartily, that I was almost deafened with the noise. This liquor
tasted like a small cider, and was not unpleasant. Then the master
made me a sign to come to his trencher side; but as I walked on the
table, being in great surprise all the time, as the indulgent reader
will easily conceive and excuse, I happened to stumble against a
crust, and fell flat on my face, but received no hurt. I got up
immediately, and observing the good people to be in much concern, I
took my hat (which I held under my arm out of good manners) and waving
it over my head, made three huzzas, to show I had gotten no mischief
by my fall. But advancing forwards toward my master (as I shall
henceforth call him), his youngest son who sat next him, an arch boy
of about ten years old, took me up by the legs, and held me so high in
the air, that I trembled every limb; but his father snatched me from
him, and at the same time gave him such a box on the left ear, as
would have felled an European troop of horse to the earth, ordering
him to be taken from the table. But being afraid the boy might owe
me a spite, and well remembering how mischievous all children among us
naturally are to sparrows, rabbits, young kittens, and puppy dogs, I
fell on my knees, and pointing to the boy, made my master to
understand, as well as I could, that I desired his son might be
pardoned. The father complied, and the lad took his seat again;
whereupon I went to him and kissed his hand, which my master took, and
made him stroke me gently with it.
In the midst of dinner, my mistress' favorite cat leaped into her
lap. I heard a noise behind me like that of a dozen stocking-weavers
at work; and turning my head, I found it proceeded from the purring of
this animal, who seemed to be three times larger than an ox, as I
computed by the view of her head, and one of her paws, while her
mistress was feeding and stroking her. The fierceness of this
creature's countenance altogether discomposed me; though I stood at
the farther end of the table, above fifty feet off and although my
mistress held her fast for fear she might give a spring, and seize
me in her talons. But it happened there was no danger; for the cat
took not the least notice of me when my master placed me within
three yards of her. And as I have been always told, and found true
by experience in my travels, that flying, or discovering fear way to
make it pursue or attack you, so I resolved in this dangerous juncture
to show no manner of concern. I walked with intrepidity five or six
times before the very head of the cat, and came within half a yard
of her; whereupon she drew herself back, as if she were more afraid of
me: I had less apprehension concerning the dogs, whereof three or four
came into the room, as it is usual in farmers' houses; one of which
was a mastiff, equal in bulk to four elephants, and a greyhound,
somewhat taller than the mastiff, but not so large.
{P_2|CH_1 ^paragraph 10}
When dinner was almost done, the nurse came in with a Child of a
year old in her arms, who immediately spied me, and began a squall
that you might have heard from London Bridge to Chelsea, after the
usual oratory of infants, to get me for a plaything. The mother out of
pure indulgence took me up, and put me towards the child, who
presently seized me by the middle, and got my head in his mouth, where
I roared so loud that the urchin was frightened, and let me drop;
and I should infallibly have broken my neck if the mother had not held
her apron under me. The nurse to quiet her babe made use of a
rattle, which was a kind of hollow vessel filled with great stones,
and fastened by a cable to the childs waist: but all in vain, so
that she was forced to apply the last remedy by giving it suck. I must
confess no object ever disgusted me so much as the sight of her
monstrous breast, which I cannot tell what to compare with, so as to
give the curious reader an idea of its bulk, shape and color. It stood
prominent six feet, and could not be less than sixteen in
circumference. The nipple was about half the size of my head, and
the hue both of that and the dug so varified with spots, pimples and
freckles, that nothing could appear more nauseous: for I had a near
sight of her, she sitting down the more conveniently to give suck, and
I standing on the table. This made me reflect upon the fair skins of
our English ladies, who appear so beautiful to us, only because they
are of our own size, and their defects not to be seen but through a
magnifying glass, where we find by experiment that the smoothest and
whitest skins look rough and coarse, and ill colored.
I remember when I was at Lilliput, the complexion of those
diminutive people appeared to me the fairest in the world; and talking
upon this subject with a person of learning there, who was an intimate
friend of mine, he said that my face appeared much fairer and smoother
when he looked on me from the ground, than it did upon a nearer view
when I took him up in my hand and brought him close, which he
confessed was at first a very shocking sight. He said he could
discover great holes in my skin; that the stumps of my beard were
ten times stronger than the bristles of a boar, and my complexion made
up of several colors altogether disagreeable: although I must beg
leave to say for myself, that I am as fair as most of my sex and
country, and very little sunburned by all my travels. On the other
side, discoursing of the ladies in that Emperor's court, he used to
tell me, one had freckles, another too wide a mouth, a third too large
a nose, nothing of which I was able to distinguish. I confess this
reflection was obvious enough; which however I could not forbear, lest
the reader might think those vast creatures were actually deformed:
for I must do them justice to say they are a comely race of people;
and particularly the features of my master's countenance, although
he were but a farmer, when I beheld him from the height of sixty feet,
appeared very well proportioned.
When dinner was done, my master went out to his laborers, and as I
could discover by his voice and gesture, gave his wife a strict charge
to take care of me. I was very much tired, and disposed to sleep,
which my mistress perceiving, she put me on her own bed, and covered
me with a clean white handkerchief, larger and coarser than the
mainsail of a man of war.
I slept about two hours, and dreamed I was at home with my wife
and children, which aggravated my sorrows when I awakened and found
myself alone in a vast room, between two and three hundred feet
wide, and above two hundred high, lying in a bed twenty yards wide. My
mistress was gone about her household affairs, and had locked me in.
The bed was eight yards from the floor. Some natural necessities
required me to get down; I dare not presume to call, and if I had,
it would have been in vain, with such a voice as mine, at so great a
distance from the room where I lay to the kitchen where the family
kept. While I was under these circumstances, two rats crept up the
curtains, and ran smelling backwards and forwards on the bed. One of
them came up almost to my face, whereupon I rose in a fright, and drew
out my hanger to defend myself. These horrible animals had the
boldness to attack me on both sides, and one of them held his
fore-feet at my collar; but I had the good fortune to rip up his belly
before he could do me any mischief. He fell down at my feet, and the
other, seeing the fate of his comrade, made his escape, but not
without one good wound on the back, which I gave him as he fled, and
made the blood run trickling from him. After this exploit, I walked
gently to and fro on the bed, to recover my breath and loss of
spirits. These creatures were of the size of a large mastiff, but
infinitely more nimble and fierce, so that if I had taken off my
belt before I went to sleep, I must have infallibly been torn to
pieces and devoured. I measured the tail of the dead rat, and found it
to be two yards long, wanting an inch; but it went against my
stomach to drag the carcass off the bed, where it lay still
bleeding; I observed it had yet some life, but with a strong slash
cross the neck, I thoroughly dispatched it.
Soon after my mistress came into the room, who seeing me all bloody,
ran and took me up in her hand. I pointed to the dead rat, smiling and
making other signs to show I was not hurt, whereat she was extremely
rejoiced, calling the maid to take up the dead rat with a pair of
tongs, and throw it out of the window. Then she set me on a table,
where I showed her my hanger all bloody, and wiping it on the lappet
of my coat, returned it to the scabbard. I was pressed to do more than
one thing, which another could not do for me, and therefore endeavored
to make my mistress understand that I desired to be set down on the
floor; which after she had done, my bashfulness would not suffer me to
express myself farther than by pointing to the door, and bowing
several times. The good woman with much difficulty at last perceived
what I would be at, and taking me up again in her hand, walked into
the garden, where she set me down. I went on one side about two
hundred yards, and beckoning to her not to look or to follow me, I hid
myself between two leaves of sorrel and there discharged the
necessities of nature.
{P_2|CH_1 ^paragraph 15}
I hope the gentle reader will excuse me for dwelling on these and
the like particulars, which however insignificant they may appear to
grovelling vulgar minds, yet will certainly help a philosopher to
enlarge his thoughts and imagination, and apply them to the benefit of
public as well as private life, which was my sole design in presenting
this and other accounts of my travels to the world; wherein I have
been chiefly studious of truth, without affecting any ornaments of
learning or of style. But the whole scene of this voyage made so
strong an impression on my mind, and is so deeply fixed in my
memory, that in committing it to paper I did not omit one material
circumstance: however, upon a strict review, I blotted out several
passages of less moment which were in my first copy, for fear of being
censured as tedious and trifling, whereof travelers are often, perhaps
not without justice, accused.

CHAPTER II
-
My mistress had a daughter of nine years old, a child of forward
parts for her age, very dextrous at her needle, and skillful in
dressing her baby. Her mother and she contrived to fit up the baby's
cradle for me against night: the cradle was put into a small drawer of
a cabinet, and the drawer placed upon a hanging shelf for fear of
the rats. This was my bed all the time I stayed with those people,
though made more convenient by degrees, as I began to learn their
language, and make my wants known. This young girl was so handy,
that after I had once or twice pulled off my clothes before her, she
was able to dress and undress me, though I never gave her that trouble
when she would let me do either myself. She made me seven shirts,
and some other linen, of as fine cloth as could be got, which indeed
was coarser than sackcloth; and these she constantly washed for me
with her own hands. She was likewise my school mistress to teach me
the language: when I pointed to anything, she told me the name of it
in her own tongue, so that in a few days I was able to call for
whatever I had a mind to. She was very good-natured, and not above
forty feet high, being little for her age. She gave me the name of
Grildrig, which the family took up, and afterwards the whole
kingdom. The word imports what the Latins call nanunculus the Italians
homunceletino, and the English mannikin. To her I chiefly owe my
preservation in that country: we never parted while I was there; I
called her my Glumdalclitch, or little nurse: and I should be guilty
of great ingratitude if I omitted this honorable mention of her care
and affection towards me, which I heartily wish it lay in my power
to requite as she deserves, instead of being the innocent but
unhappy instrument of her disgrace, as I have too much reason to fear.
It now began to be known and talked of in the neighborhood, that
my master had found a strange animal in the field, about the bigness
of a splacknuck, but exactly shaped in every part like a human
creature; which it likewise imitated in all its actions; seemed to
speak in a little language of its own, had already learned several
words of theirs, went erect upon two legs, was tame and gentle,
would come when it was called, do whatever it was bid, had the
finest limbs in the world, and a complexion fairer than a nobleman's
daughter of three years old. Another farmer who lived hard by, and was
a particular friend of my master, came on a visit on purpose to
inquire into the truth of this story. I was immediately produced,
and placed upon a table, where I walked as I was commanded, drew my
hanger, put it up again, made my reverence to my master's guest, asked
him in his own language how he did, and told him he was welcome,
just as my little nurse had instructed me. This man, who was old and
dim-sighted, put on his spectacles to behold me better, at which I
could not forbear laughing very heartily, for his eyes appeared like
the full moon shining into a chamber at two windows. Our people, who
discovered the cause of my mirth, bore me company in laughing, at
which the old fellow was fool enough to be angry and out of
countenance. He had the character of a great miser, and to my
misfortune he well deserved it, by the cursed advice he gave my master
to show me as a sight upon a market day in the next town, which was
half an hour's riding, about twenty-two miles from our house. I
guessed there was some mischief contriving, when I observed my
master and his friend whispering long together, sometimes pointing
at me; and my fears made me fancy that I overheard and understood some
of their words. But the next morning Glumdalclitch, my little nurse,
told me the whole matter, which she had cunningly picked out from
her mother. The poor girl laid me on her bosom, and fell weeping
with shame and grief. She apprehended some mischief would happen to me
from rude vulgar folks, who might squeeze me to death, or break one of
my limbs by taking me in their hands. She had also observed how modest
I was in my nature, how nicely I regarded my honor, and what an
indignity I should conceive it to be exposed for money as a public
spectacle to the meanest of the people. She said, her papa and mamma
had promised that Grildrig should be hers, but now she found they
meant to serve her as they did last year, when they pretended to
give her a lamb, and yet, as soon as it was fat, sold it to a butcher.
For my own part, I may truly affirm that I was less concerned than
my nurse. I had a strong hope which never left me, that I should one
day recover my liberty; and as to the ignominy of being carried
about for a monster, I considered myself to be a perfect stranger in
the country, and that such a misfortune could never be charged upon me
as a reproach, if ever I should return to England; since the King of
Great Britain himself, in my condition, must have undergone the same
distress.
My master, pursuant to the advice of his friend, carried me in a box
the next market day to the neighboring town, and took along with him
his little daughter, my nurse, upon a pillion behind him. The box
was close on every side, with a little door for me to go in and out,
and a few gimlet holes to let in air. The girl had been so careful
to put the quilt of her baby's bed into it, for me to lie down on.
However, I was terribly shaken and discomposed in this journey, though
it were but of half an hour. For the horse went about forty feet at
every step, and trotted so high, that the agitation was equal to the
rising and falling of a ship in a great storm, but much more frequent.
Our journey was somewhat further than from London to St. Albans. My
master alighted at an inn which he used to frequent; and after
consulting a while with the inn-keeper, and making some necessary
preparations, he hired the Grultrud, or crier, to give notice
through the town of a strange creature to be seen at the Sign of the
Green Eagle, not so big as a splacknuck (an animal in that country
very finely shaped, about six foot long) and in every part of the body
resembling a human creature, could speak several words, and perform
a hundred diverting tricks.
I was placed upon a table in the largest room of the inn, which
might be near three hundred feet square. My little nurse stood on a
low stool close to the table, to take care of me, and direct what I
should do. My master, to avoid a crowd, would suffer only thirty
people at a time to see me. I walked about on the table as the girl
commanded: she asked me questions as far as she knew my
understanding of the language reached, and I answered them as loud
as I could. I turned about several times to the company, paid my
humble respects, said they were welcome, and used some other
speeches I had been taught. I took up a thimble filled with liquor,
which Glumdalclitch had given me for a cup, and drank their health.
I drew out my hanger, and flourished it after the manner of fencers in
England. My nurse gave me part of a straw, which I exercised as a
pike, having learned the art in my youth. I was that day shown to
twelve sets of company, and as often forced to go over again with
the same fopperies, till I was half dead with weariness and
vexation. For those who had seen me made such wonderful reports,
that the people were ready to break down the doors to come in. My
master for his own interest would not suffer any one to touch me
except my nurse; and, to prevent danger, benches were set around the
table at such a distance as put me out of everybody's reach.
However, an unlucky schoolboy aimed a hazel nut directly at my head,
which very narrowly missed me; otherwise, it came with so much
violence, that it would have infallibly knocked out my brains, for
it was almost as large as a small pumpion: but I had the
satisfaction to see the young rogue well beaten, and turned out of the
room.
My master gave public notice that he would show me again the next
market day, and in the meantime he prepared a more convenient
vehicle for me, which he had reason enough to do; for I was so tired
with my first journey, and with entertaining company for eight hours
together, that I could hardly stand upon my legs or speak a word. It
was at least three days before I recovered my strength; and that I
might have no rest at home, all the neighboring gentlemen from a
hundred miles around, hearing of my fame, came to see me at my
master's own house. There could not be fewer than thirty persons
with their wives and children (for the country is very populous);
and my master demanded the rate of a full room whenever he showed me
at home, although it were only to a single family; so that for some
time I had but little ease every day of the week (except Wednesday,
which is their Sabbath) although I were not carried to the town.
{P_2|CH_2 ^paragraph 5}
My master, finding how profitable I was likely to be, resolved to
carry me to the most considerable cities of the kingdom. Having
therefore provided himself with all things necessary for a long
journey, and settled his affairs at home, he took leave of his wife,
and upon the 17th of August, 1703, about two months after my
arrival, we set out for the metropolis, situated near the middle of
that empire, and about three thousand miles distance from our house.
My master made his daughter Glumdalclitch ride behind him. She carried
me on her lap in a box tied about her waist. The girl had lined it
on all sides with the softest cloth she could get, well quilted
underneath, furnished it with her baby's bed, provided me with linen
and other necessaries, and made everything as convenient as she could.
We had no other company but a boy of the house, who rode after us with
the luggage.
My master's design was to show me in all the towns by the way, and
to step out of the road for fifty or a hundred miles, to any village
or person of quality's house where he might expect custom. We made
easy journeys of not above seven or eight score miles a day: for
Glumdalclitch, on purpose to spare me, complained she was tired with
the trotting of the horse. She often took me out of my box at my own
desire, to give me air and show me the country, but always held me
fast by a leading string. We passed over five or six rivers many
degrees broader and deeper than the Nile or the Ganges; and there
was hardly a rivulet so small as the Thames at London Bridge. We
were ten weeks in our journey, and I was shown in eighteen large towns
besides many villages and private families.
On the 26th day of October, we arrived at the metropolis, called
in their language Lorbrulgrud, or Pride of the Universe. My master
took a lodging in the principal street of the city, not far from the
royal palace, and put out bills in the usual form, containing an exact
description of my person and parts. He hired a large room between
three and four hundred feet wide. He provided a table sixty feet in
diameter, upon which I was to act my part, and palisadoed it around
three feet from the edge, and as many high, to prevent my falling
over. I was shown ten times a day to the wonder and satisfaction of
all people. I could now speak the language tolerably well, and
perfectly understood every word that was spoken to me. Besides, I
had learned their alphabet, and could make a shift to explain a
sentence here and there; for Glumdalclitch had been my instructor
while we were at home, and at leisure hours during our journey. She
carried a little book in her pocket, not much larger than a Sanson's
Atlas; it was a common treatise for the use of young girls, giving a
short account of their religion: out of this she taught me my letters,
and interpreted the words.

CHAPTER III
-
The frequent labors I underwent every day made in a few weeks a very
considerable change in my health: the more my master got by me, the
more unsatiable he grew. I had quite lost my stomach, and was almost
reduced to a skeleton. The farmer observed it, and concluding I soon
must die, resolved to make as good a hand of me as he could. While
he was thus reasoning and resolving with himself, a Slardral, or
Gentleman Usher, came from court, commanding my master to carry me
immediately thither for the diversion of the Queen and her ladies.
Some of the latter had already been to see me, and reported strange
things of my beauty, behavior, and good sense. Her Majesty and those
who attended her were beyond measure delighted with my demeanor. I
fell on my knees, and begged the honor of kissing her Imperial foot;
but this gracious princess held out her little finger towards me
(after I was set on a table) which I embraced in both my arms, and put
the tip of it with the utmost respect to my lip. She made me some
general questions about my country and my travels, which I answered as
distinctly and in as few words as I could. She asked whether I would
be content to live at court. I bowed down to the board of the table,
and humbly answered, that I was my master's slave, but if I were at my
own disposal, I should be proud to devote my life to her Majesty's
service. She then asked my master whether he were willing to sell me
at a good price. He, who apprehended I could not live a month, was
ready enough to part with me, and demanded a thousand pieces of
gold, which were ordered him on the spot, each piece being about the
bigness of eight hundred moidores; but, allowing for the proportion of
all things between that country and Europe, and the high price of gold
among them, was hardly so great a sum as a thousand guineas would be
in England. I then said to the Queen, since I was now her Majesty's
most humble creature and vassal, I must beg the favor, that
Glumdalclitch, who had always tended me with so much care and
kindness, and understood to do it so well, might be admitted into
her service, and continue to be my nurse and instructor. Her Majesty
agreed to my petition, and easily got the farmer's consent, who was
glad enough to have his daughter preferred at court: and the poor girl
herself was not able to hide her joy. My late master withdrew, bidding
me farewell, and saying he had left me in a good service; to which I
replied not a word, only making him a slight bow.
The Queen observed my coldness, and when the farmer was gone out
of the apartment, asked me the reason. I made bold to tell her Majesty
that I owed no other obligation to my late master, than his not
dashing out the brains of a poor harmless creature found by chance
in his field; which obligation was amply recompensed by the gain he
had made in showing me through half the kingdom, and the price he
had now sold me for. That the life I had since led was laborious
enough to kill an animal of ten times my strength. That my health
was much impaired by the continual drudgery of entertaining the rabble
every hour of the day, and that if my master had not thought my life
in danger, her Majesty perhaps would not have got so cheap a
bargain. But as I was out of all fear of being ill treated under the
protection of so great and good an Empress, the Ornament of Nature,
the Darling of the World, the Delight of her Subjects, the Phoenix
of the Creation; so I hoped my late master's apprehensions would
appear to be groundless, for I already found my spirits to revive by
the influence of her most august presence.
This was the sum of my speech, delivered with great improprieties
and hesitation; the latter part was altogether framed in the style
peculiar to that people, whereof I learned some phrases from
Glumdalclitch, while she was carrying me to court.
The Queen giving great allowance for my defectiveness in speaking,
was however surprised at so much wit and good sense in so diminutive
an animal. She took me in her own hand, and carried me to the King,
who was then retired to his cabinet. His Majesty, a prince of much
gravity, and austere countenance, not well observing my shape at first
view, asked the Queen after a cold manner, how long it was since she
grew fond of a splacknuck; for such it seems he took me to be, as I
lay upon my breast in her Majesty's right hand. But this princess, who
has an infinite deal of wit and humor, set me gently on my feet upon
the scrutore, and commanded me to give his Majesty an account of
myself, which I did in a very few words; and Glumdalclitch, who
attended at the cabinet door, and could not endure I should be out
of her sight, being admitted, confirmed all that had passed from my
arrival at her father's house.
The King, although he be as learned a person as any in his
dominions, and had been educated in the study of philosophy, and
particularly mathematics; yet when he observed my shape exactly, and
saw me walk erect, before I began to speak, conceived I might be a
piece of clockwork (which is in that country arrived to a very great
perfection), contrived by some ingenious artist. But when he heard
my voice, and found what I delivered to be regular and rational, he
could not conceal his astonishment. He was by no means satisfied
with the relation I gave him of the manner I came into his kingdom,
but thought it a story concerted between Glumdalclitch and her father,
who had taught me a set of words to make me sell at a higher price.
Upon this imagination he put several other questions to me, and
still received rational answers, no otherwise defective than by a
foreign accent, and an imperfect knowledge in the language, with
some rustic phrases which I had learned at the farmer's house, and did
not suit the polite style of a court.
{P_2|CH_3 ^paragraph 5}
His Majesty sent for three great scholars who were then in their
weekly waiting, according to the custom in that country. These
gentlemen, after they had awhile examined my shape with much nicety,
were of different opinions concerning me. They all agreed that I could
not be produced according to the regular laws of nature, because I was
not framed with a capacity of preserving my life, either by swiftness,
or climbing of trees, or digging holes in the earth. They observed
by my teeth, which they viewed with great exactness, that I was a
carnivorous animal; yet most quadrupeds being an overmatch for me, and
field mice, with some others, too nimble, they could not imagine how I
should be able to support myself, unless I fed upon snails and other
insects, which they offered, by many learned arguments, to evince that
I could not possibly do. One of these virtuosi seemed to think that
I might be an embryo, or abortive birth. But this opinion was rejected
by the other two, who observed my limbs to be perfect and finished,
and that I had lived several years, as it was manifested from my
beard, the stumps whereof they plainly discovered through a magnifying
glass. They would not allow me to be a dwarf, because my littleness
was beyond all degrees of comparison; for the Queen's favorite
dwarf, the smallest ever known in that kingdom, was nearly thirty feet
high. After much debate, they concluded unanimously that I was only
relplum scalcath, which is interpreted literally, lusus naturae; a
determination exactly agreeable to the modern philosophy of Europe,
whose professors, disdaining the old evasion of occult causes, whereby
the followers of Artistotle endeavor in vain to disguise their
ignorance, have invented this wonderful solution of all
difficulties, to the unspeakable advancement of human knowledge.
After this decisive conclusion, I entreated to be heard a word or
two. I applied myself to the King, and assured his Majesty, that I
came from a country which abounded with several millions of both
sexes, and of my own stature; where the animals, trees, and houses
were all in proportion, and where by consequence I might be as able to
defend myself, and to find sustenance, as any of his Majesty's
subjects could do here; which I took for a full answer to those
gentlemen's arguments. To this they only replied with a smile of
contempt, saying that the farmer had instructed me very well in my
lesson. The King, who had a much better understanding, dismissing
his learned men, sent for the farmer, who by good fortune was not
yet gone out of town. Having therefore first examined him privately,
and then confronted him with me and the young girl, his Majesty
began to think that what we told him might possibly be true. He
desired the Queen to order that a particular care should be taken of
me, and was of opinion that Glumdalclitch should still continue in her
office of tending me, because he observed we had a great affection for
each other. A convenient apartment was provided for her at court;
she had a sort of governess appointed to take care of her education, a
maid to dress her, and two other servants for menial offices; but
the care of me was wholly appropriated to herself. The Queen commanded
her own cabinet maker to contrive a box that might serve me for a
bedchamber, after the model that Glumdalclitch and I should agree
upon. This man was a most ingenious artist, and according to my
directions, in three weeks finished for me a wooden chamber of sixteen
feet square, and twelve high, with sash windows, a door, and two
closets, like a London bedchamber. The board that made the ceiling was
to be lifted up and down by two hinges, to put in a bed ready
furnished by her Majesty's upholsterer, which Glumdalclitch took out
every day to air, made it with her own hands, and letting it down at
night, locked up the roof over me. A nice workman, who was famous
for little curiosities, undertook to make me two chairs, with backs
and frames, of a substance not unlike ivory, and two tables, with a
cabinet to put my things in. The room was quilted on all sides, as
well as the floor and the ceiling, to prevent any accident from the
carelessness of those who carried me, and to break the force of a jolt
when I went in a coach. I desired a lock for my door, to prevent
rats and mice from coming in: the smith, after several attempts,
made the smallest that ever was seen among them, for I have known a
larger at the gate of a gentleman's house in England. I made a shift
to keep the key in a pocket of my own, fearing Glumdalclitch might
lose it. The Queen likewise ordered the thinnest silks that could be
gotten, to make me clothes, not much thicker than an English
blanket, very cumbersome till I was accustomed to them. They were
after the fashion of the kingdom, partly resembling the Persian, and
partly the Chinese, and are a very grave and decent habit.
The Queen became so fond of my company, that she could not dine
without me. I had a table placed upon the same at which her Majesty
ate, just at her left elbow, and a chair to sit on. Glumdalclitch
stood upon a stool on the floor, near my table, to assist and take
care of me. I had an entire set of silver dishes and plates, and other
necessaries, which, in proportion to those of the Queen, were not much
bigger than what I have seen of the same kind in a London toy shop,
for the furniture of a babyhouse: these my little nurse kept in her
pocket in a silver box, and gave me at meals as I wanted them,
always cleaning them herself. No person dined with the Queen but the
two Princesses Royal, the elder sixteen years old, and the younger
at that time thirteen and a month. Her Majesty used to put a bit of
meat upon one of my dishes, out of which I carved for myself, and
her diversion was to see me eat in miniature. For the Queen (who had
indeed but a weak stomach) took up at one mouthful as much as a
dozen English farmers could eat at a meal, which to me was for some
time a very nauseous sight. She would crunch the wing of a lark, bones
and all, between her teeth, although it were nine times as large as
that of a full grown turkey; and put a bit of bread into her mouth, as
big as two twelve-penny loaves. She drank out of a golden cup, above a
hogshead at a draught. Her knives were twice as long as a scythe set
straight upon the handle. The spoons, forks, and other instruments
were all in the same proportion. I remember when Glumdalclitch carried
me out of curiosity to see some of the tables at court, where ten or a
dozen of these enormous knives and forks were lifted up together, I
thought I had never till then beheld so terrible a sight.
It is the custom that every Wednesday (which, as I have before
observed, was their Sabbath) the King and Queen, with the royal
issue of both sexes, dine together in the apartment of his Majesty, to
whom I was now become a great favorite; and at these times my little
chair and table were placed at his left hand, before one of the salt
cellars. This prince took a pleasure in conversing with me,
inquiring into the manners, religion, laws, government, and learning
of Europe; wherein I gave him the best account I was able. His
apprehension was so clear, and his judgment so exact, that he made
very wise reflections and observations upon all I said. But, I
confess, that after I had been a little too copious in talking of my
own beloved country, of our trade, and wars by sea and land, of our
schisms in religion, and parties in the state, the prejudices of his
education prevailed so far, that he could not forbear taking me up
in his right hand, and stroking me gently with the other, after an
hearty fit of laughing, asked me whether I were a Whig or a Tory. Then
turning to his first minister, who waited behind him with a white
staff, near as tall as the mainmast of the Royal Sovereign, he
observed how contemptible a thing was human grandeur, which could be
mimicked by such diminutive insects as I: and yet, said he, I dare
engage, these creatures have their titles and distinctions of honor,
they contrive little nests and burrows, that they call houses and
cities; they make a figure in dress and equipage; they love, they
fight, they dispute, they cheat, they betray. And thus he continued
on, while my color came and went several times with indignation to
hear our noble country, the mistress of arts and arms, the scourge
of France, the arbitress of Europe, the seat of virtue, piety, honor
and truth, the pride and envy of the world, contemptuously treated.
But as I was not in a condition to resent injuries, so, upon
mature thoughts, I began to doubt whether I were injured or not.
For, after having been accustomed several months to the sight and
converse of this people, and observed every object upon which I cast
my eyes to be of proportionable magnitude, the horror I had first
conceived from their bulk and aspect was so far worn off, that if I
had then beheld a company of English lords and ladies in their
finery and best day clothes, acting their several parts in the most
courtly manner, of strutting, and bowing, and prating, to say the
truth, I should have been strongly tempted to laugh as much at them as
the King and his grandees did at me. Neither indeed could I forbear
smiling at myself, when the Queen used to place me upon her hand
towards a looking glass, by which both our persons appeared before
me in full view together! and there could be nothing more ridiculous
than the comparison; so that I really began to imagine myself dwindled
many degrees below my usual size.
{P_2|CH_3 ^paragraph 10}
Nothing angered and mortified me so much as the Queen's dwarf, who
being of the lowest stature that was ever that country (for I verily
think he was not thirty feet high) became insolent at seeing a
creature so much beneath him, that he would always affect to swagger
and look big as he passed by me in the Queen's antechamber, while I
was standing on some table talking with the lords or ladies of the
court, and he seldom failed of a smart word or two upon my littleness;
against which I could only revenge myself by calling him brother,
challenging him to wrestle, and such repartees as are usual in the
mouths of court pages. One day at dinner this malicious little cub was
so nettled with something I had said to him, that raising himself upon
the frame of her Majesty's chair, he took me up by the middle, as I
was sitting down, not thinking any harm, and let me drop into a
large silver bowl of cream, and then ran away as fast as he could. I
fell over head and ears, and if I had not been a good swimmer, it
might have gone very hard with me; for Glumdalclitch in that instant
happened to be at the other end of the room, and the Queen was in such
a fright that she wanted presence of mind to assist me. But my
little nurse ran to my relief, and took me out, after I had
swallowed above a quart of cream. I was put to bed; however, I
received no other damage than the loss of a suit of clothes, which was
utterly spoiled. The dwarf was soundly whipped, and as a farther
punishment, forced to drink up the bowl of cream, into which he had
thrown me; neither was he ever restored to favor; for soon after the
Queen bestowed him to a lady of high quality, so that I saw him no
more, to my very great satisfaction; for I could not tell to what
extremity such a malicious urchin might have carried his resentment.
He had before served me a scurvy trick, which set the Queen a
laughing, although at the same time she was heartily vexed, and
would have immediately cashiered him, if I had not been so generous as
to intercede. Her Majesty had taken a marrow bone upon her plate,
and after knocking out the marrow, placed the bone again in the dish
erect as it stood before; the dwarf watching his opportunity, while
Glumdalclitch was gone to the sideboard, mounted upon the stool she
stood on to take care of me at meals, took me up in both hands, and
squeezing my legs together, wedged them into the marrow bone above
my waist, where I stuck for some time, and made a very ridiculous
figure. I believe it was near a minute before any one knew what was
become of me, for I thought it below me to cry out. But, as princes
seldom get their meat hot, my legs were not scalded, only my stockings
and breeches in a sad condition. The dwarf at my entreaty had no other
punishment than a sound whipping.
I was frequently rallied by the Queen upon account of my
fearfulness, and she used to ask me whether the people of ray
country were as great cowards as myself. The occasion was this. The
kingdom is much pestered with flies in summer; and these odious
insects, each of them as big as a Dunstable lark, hardly gave me any
rest while I sat at dinner, with their continual humming and buzzing
about my ears. They would sometimes alight upon my victuals; and leave
their loathsome excrement or spawn behind, which to me was very
visible, though not to the natives of that country, whose large optics
were not so acute as mine in viewing smaller objects. Sometimes they
would fix upon my nose or forehead, where they stung me to the
quick, smelling very offensively, and I could easily trace that
viscous matter, which our naturalists tell us enables those
creatures to walk with their feet upwards upon a ceiling. I had much
ado to defend myself against these detestable animals, and could not
forbear starting when they came on my face. It was the common practice
of the dwarf to catch a number of these insects in his hand, as
schoolboys do among us, and let them out suddenly under my nose, on
purpose to frighten me, and divert the Queen. My remedy was to cut
them in pieces with my knife as they flew in the air, wherein my
dexterity was much admired.
I remember one morning when Glumdalclitch had set me in my box
upon a window, as she usually did in fair days to give me air (for I
dared not venture to let the box be hung on a nail out of the
window, as we do with cages in England) after I had lifted up one of
my sashes, and sat down at my table to eat a piece of sweet cake for
my breakfast, above twenty wasps, allured by the smell, came flying
into the room, humming louder than the drones of as many bagpipes.
Some of them seized my cake, and carried it piecemeal away, others
flew about my head and face, confounding me with the noise, and
putting me in the utmost terror of their stings. However I had the
courage to rise and draw my hanger, and attack them in the air. I
dispatched four of them, but the rest got away, and I presently shut
my window. These insects were as large as partridges: I took out their
stings, found them an inch and a half long, and as sharp as needles. I
carefully preserved them all, and having since shown them with some
other curiosities in several parts of Europe, upon my return to
England I gave three of them to Gresham College, and kept the fourth
for myself.

P_2|CH_4
CHAPTER IV
-
I now intend to give the reader a short description of this country,
as far as I traveled in it, which was not above two thousand miles
round Lorbrulgrud, the metropolis. For the Queen, whom I always
attended, never went further when she accompanied the King in his
progresses, and there stayed until his Majesty returned from viewing
his frontiers. The whole extent of this prince's dominions reaches
about six thousand miles in length, and from three to five in breadth.
From whence I cannot but conclude that our geographers of Europe are
in a great error, by supposing nothing but sea between Japan and
California; for it was ever my opinion, that there must be a balance
of earth to counterpoise the great continent of Tartary; and therefore
they ought to correct their maps and charts, by joining this vast
tract of land to the northwest parts of America, wherein I shall be
ready to lend them my assistance.
The kingdom is a peninsula, terminated to the northeast by a ridge
of mountains thirty miles high, which are altogether impassable by
reason of the volcanoes upon the tops. Neither do the most learned
know what sort of mortals inhabit beyond those mountains, or whether
they be inhabited at all. On the three other sides it is bounded by
the ocean. There is not one seaport in the whole kingdom, and those
parts of the coasts into which the rivers issue are so full of pointed
rocks, and the sea generally so rough, that there is no venturing with
the smallest of their boats, so that these people are wholly
excluded from any commerce with the rest of the world. But the large
rivers are full of vessels, and abound with excellent fish, for they
seldom get any from the sea because the sea fish are of the same
size with those in Europe, and consequently not worth catching;
whereby it is manifest, that nature, in the production of plants and
animals of so extraordinary a bulk, is wholly confined to this
continent, of which I leave the reasons to be determined by
philosophers. However, now and then they take a whale that happens
to be dashed against the rocks, which the common people feed on
heartily. These whales I have known so large that a man could hardly
carry one upon his shoulders; and sometimes for curiosity they are
brought in hampers to Lorbrulgrud: I saw one of them in a dish at
the King's table, which passed for a rarity, but I did not observe
he was fond of it; for I think indeed the bigness disgusted him,
although I have seen one somewhat larger in Greenland.
The country is well inhabited, for it contains fifty-one cities,
near a hundred walled towns, and a great number of villages. To
satisfy my curious reader, it may be sufficient to describe
Lorbrulgrud. This city stands upon almost two equal parts on each side
the river that passes through. It contains above eighty thousand
houses, and about six hundred thousand inhabitants. It is in length
three glonglungs (which make about fifty-four English miles) and two
and a half in breadth, as I measured it myself in the royal map made
by the King's order, which was laid on the ground on purpose for me,
and extended a hundred feet; I paced the diameter and circumference
several times barefoot, and computing by the scale, measured it pretty
exactly.
The King's palace is no regular edifice, but a heap of building
about seven miles around: the chief rooms are generally two hundred
and forty feet high, and broad and long proportion. A coach was
allowed to Glumdalclitch and me, wherein her governess frequently took
her out to see the town, or go among the shops; and I was always of
the party, carried in my box; although the girl at my own desire would
often take me out, and hold me in her hand, that I might more
conveniently view the houses and the people, as we passed along the
streets. I reckoned our coach to be about a square of Westminster
Hall, but not altogether so high; however, I cannot be very exact. One
day the governess ordered our coachman to stop at several shops, where
the beggars, watching their opportunity, crowded to the sides of the
coach, and gave me the most horrible spectacles that ever an English
eye beheld. There was a woman with a cancer in her breast, swelled
to a monstrous size, full of holes, in two or three of which I could
have easily crept, and covered my whole body. There was a fellow
with a wen in his neck, larger than five wool-packs, and another
with a couple of wooden legs, each about twenty feet high. But the
most hateful sight of all was the lice crawling on their clothes. I
could see distinctly the limbs of these vermin with my naked eye, much
better than those of an European louse through a microscope, and their
snouts with which they rooted like swine. They were the first I had
ever beheld, and I should have been curious enough to dissect one of
them, if I had proper instruments (which I unluckily left behind me in
the shop) although indeed the sight was so nauseous, that it perfectly
turned my stomach.
Besides the large box in which I was usually carried, the Queen
ordered a smaller one to be made for me, of about twelve feet
square, and ten high, for the convenience of traveling, because the
other was somewhat too large for Glumdalclitch's lap, and cumbersome
in the coach; it was made by the same artist, whom I directed in the
whole contrivance. This traveling closet was an exact square with a
window in the middle of three of the squares, and each window was
latticed with iron wire on the outside, to prevent accidents in long
journeys. On the fourth side, which had no window, two strong
staples were fixed, through which the person that carried me, when I
had a mind to be on horseback, put in a leathern belt, and buckled
it about his waist. This was always the office of some grave trusty
servant in whom I could confide, whether I attended the King and Queen
in their progresses, or were disposed to see the gardens, or pay a
visit to some great lady or minister of state in the court, when
Glumdalclitch happened to be out of order: for I soon began to be
known and esteemed among the greatest officers, I suppose more upon
account of their Majesties' favor, than any merit of my own. In
journeys, when I was weary of the coach, a servant on horseback
would buckle my box, and place it on a cushion before him; and there I
had a full prospect of the country on three sides from my three
windows. I had in this closet a field bed and a hung from the ceiling,
two chairs and a table, neatly screwed to the floor, to prevent
being tossed about by the agitation of the horse or the coach. And
having been long used to sea voyages, those motions, although
sometimes very violent, did not much discompose me.
{P_2|CH_4 ^paragraph 5}
Whenever I had a mind to see the town, it was always in my traveling
closet, which Glumdalclitch held in her lap in a kind of open sedan,
after the fashion of the country, borne by four men, and attended by
two others in the Queen's livery. The people who had often heard of
me, were very curious to crowd about the sedan, and the girl was
complaisant enough to make the bearers stop, and to take me in her
hand that I might be more conveniently seen.
I was very desirous to see the chief temple, and particularly the
tower belonging to it, which is reckoned the highest in the kingdom.
Accordingly, one day my nurse carried me thither, but I may truly
say I came back disappointed; for height is not above three thousand
feet, reckoning from the ground to the highest pinnacle top; which
allowing for the difference between the size of those people and us in
Europe, is no great matter for admiration, nor at all equal in
proportion (if I rightly remember) to Salisbury steeple. But, not to
detract from a nation to which during my life I shall acknowledge
myself extremely obliged, it must be allowed that whatever this famous
tower wants in height is amply made up in beauty and strength. For the
walls are near a hundred feet thick, built of hewn stone, whereof each
is about forty feet square, and adorned on all sides with statues of
gods and emperors cut in marble larger than the life, placed in
their several niches. I measured a little finger which had fallen down
from one of these statues, and lay unperceived among some rubbish, and
found it exactly four feet and an inch in length. Glumdalclitch
wrapped it up in a handkerchief, and carried it home in her pocket
to keep among other trinkets, of which the girl was very fond, as
children at her age usually are.
The King's kitchen is indeed a noble building, vaulted at top, and
about six hundred feet high. The great oven is not so wide by ten
yards as the cupola at St. Paul's; for I measured the latter on
purpose after my return. But if I should describe the kitchen grate,
the prodigious pots and kettles, the joints of meat turning on the
spits, with many other particulars, perhaps I should be hardly
believed; at least a severe critic would be apt to think I enlarged
a little, as travelers are often suspected to do. To avoid which
censure, I fear I have run too much into the other extreme; and that
if this treatise should happen to be translated into the language of
Brobdingnag (which is the general name of that kingdom) and
transmitted thither, the King and his people would have reason to
complain that I had done them an injury by a false and diminutive
representation.
His Majesty seldom keeps above six hundred horses in his stables:
they are generally from fifty-four to sixty feet high. But when he
goes abroad on solemn days, he is attended for state by a militia
guard of five hundred horse, which indeed I thought was the most
splendid sight that could be ever beheld, till I saw part of his
army in battalia, whereof I shall find another occasion to speak.

CHAPTER V
-
I should have lived happy enough in that country, if my littleness
had not exposed me to several ridiculous and troublesome accidents,
some of which I shall venture to relate. Glumdalclitch often carried
me into the gardens of the court in my smaller box, and would
sometimes take me out of it and hold me in her hand, or set me down to
walk. I remember, before the dwarf left the Queen, he followed us
one day into those gardens, and my nurse having set me down, he and
I being close together, near some dwarf apple trees, I must needs show
my wit by a silly allusion between him and the trees, which happens to
hold in their language as it does in ours. Whereupon, the malicious
rogue watching his opportunity, when I was walking under one of
them, shook it directly over my head, by which a dozen apples, each of
them near as large as a Bristol barrel, came tumbling about my ears;
one of them hit me on the back as I chanced to stoop, and knocked me
down flat on my face, but I received no other hurt, and the dwarf
was pardoned at my desire, because I had given the provocation.
Another day Glumdalclitch left me on a smooth grass plot to divert
myself while she walked at some distance with her governess. In the
meantime there suddenly fell such a violent shower of hail, that I was
immediately by the force of it struck to the ground: and when I was
down, the hailstones gave me such cruel bangs all over the body, as if
I had been pelted with tennis balls; however, I made a shift to
creep on all fours, and shelter myself by lying flat on my face on the
lee side of a border of lemon thyme, but so bruised from head to
foot that I could not go abroad in ten days. Neither is this at all to
be wondered at, because nature in that country observing the same
proportion through all her operations, a hailstone is near eighteen
hundred times as large as one in Europe, which I can assert upon
experience, having been so curious to weigh and measure them.
But a more dangerous accident happened to me in the same garden,
when my little nurse believing she had put me in a secure place, which
I often entreated her to do, that might enjoy my own thoughts, and
having left my box at home to avoid the trouble of carrying it, went
to another part of the garden with her governess and some ladies of
her acquaintance. While she was absent and out of hearing, a small
white spaniel belonging to one of the chief gardeners, having got by
accident into the garden, happened to range near the place where I
lay. The dog following the scent, came directly up, and taking me in
his mouth, ran straight to his master, wagging his tail, and set me
gently on the ground. By good fortune he had been so well taught, that
I was carried between his teeth without the least hurt, or even
tearing my clothes. But the poor gardener, who knew me well, and had a
great kindness for me, was in a terrible fright. He gently took me
up in both his hands, and asked me how I did; but I was so amazed
and out of breath, that I could not speak a word. In a few minutes I
came to myself, and he carried me safe to my little nurse, who by this
time had returned to the place where she left me, and was in cruel
agonies when I did not appear, nor answer when she called: she
severely reprimanded the gardener on account of his dog. But the thing
was hushed up, and never known at court; for the girl was afraid of
the Queen's anger, and truly as to myself, I thought it would not be
for my reputation that such a story should go about.
This accident absolutely determined Glumdalclitch never to trust
me abroad for the future out of her sight. I had been long afraid of
this resolution, and therefore concealed from her some little
unlucky adventures that happened in those times when I was left by
myself. Once a kite hovering over the garden made a swoop at me, and
if I had not resolutely drawn my hanger, and run under a thick
espalier, he would have certainly carried me away in his talons.
Another time walking to the top of a fresh molehill, I fell to my neck
in the hole through which that animal had cast up the earth, and
coined some lie, not worth remembering, to excuse myself for
spoiling my clothes. I likewise broke my right shin against the
shell of a snail, which I happened to stumble over, as I was walking
alone, and thinking on poor England.
I cannot tell whether I were more pleased or mortified, to observe
in those solitary walks that the smaller birds did not appear to be at
all afraid of me, but would hop about within a yard's distance,
looking for worms and other food with as much indifference and
security as if no creature at all were near them. I remember a
thrush had the confidence to snatch out of my hand with his bill a
piece of cake that Glumdalclitch had just given me for my breakfast.
When I attempted to catch any of these birds, they would boldly turn
against me, endeavoring to pick my fingers, which I dared not
venture within their reach; and then they would hop back unconcerned
to hunt for worms or snails, as they did before. But one day I took
a thick cudgel, and threw it with all my strength so luckily at a
linnet that I knocked him down, and seizing him by the neck with
both my hands, ran with him in triumph to my nurse. However, the bird,
who had only been stunned, recovering himself, gave me so many boxes
with his wings on both sides of my head and body, though I held him at
arm's length, and was out of the reach of his claws, that I was twenty
times thinking to let him go. But I was soon relieved by one of our
servants, who wrung off the bird's neck, and I had him next day for
dinner, by the Queen's command. This as near as I can remember, to
be somewhat larger than an English swan.
{P_2|CH_5 ^paragraph 5}
The Maids of Honor often invited Glumdalclitch to their
apartments, and desired she would bring me along with her, on
purpose to have the pleasure of seeing and touching me. They would
often strip me naked from top to toe, and lay me at full length in
their bosoms; wherewith I was much disgusted; because, to say the
truth, a very offensive smell came from their skins; which I do not
mention or intend to the disadvantage of those excellent ladies, for
whom I have all manner of respect; but I conceive that my sense was
more acute in proportion to my littleness, and that those
illustrious persons were no more disagreeable to their lovers, or to
each other, than people of the same quality are with us in England.
And, after all, I found their natural smell was much more
supportable than when they used perfumes, under which I immediately
swooned away. I cannot forget that an intimate friend of mine in
Lilliput took the freedom in a warm day, when I had used a good deal
of exercise, to complain of a strong smell about me, although I am
as little faulty that way as most of my sex: but I suppose his faculty
of smelling was as nice with regard to me, as mine was to that of this
people. Upon this point, I cannot forbear doing justice to the Queen
my mistress, and Glumdalclitch my nurse, whose persons were as sweet
as those of any lady in England.
That which gave me most uneasiness among these Maids of Honor,
when my nurse carried me to visit them, was to see them use me without
any manner of ceremony, like a creature who had no sort of
consequence. For they would strip themselves to the skin, and put on
their smocks in my presence, while I was placed on their toilet
directly before their naked bodies, which, I am sure, to me was very
far from being a tempting sight, or from giving me any other
emotions than those of horror and disgust. Their skins appeared so
coarse and uneven, so variously colored, when I saw them near, with
a mole here and there as broad as a trencher, and hairs hanging from
it thicker than packthreads, to say nothing further concerning the
rest of their persons. Neither did they at all scruple, while I was
by, to discharge what they had drunk, to the quantity of at least
two hogsheads, in a vessel that held above three tons. The
handsomest among these Maids of Honor, a pleasant frolicsome girl of
sixteen, would sometimes set me astride upon one of her nipples,
with many other tricks, wherein the reader will excuse me for not
being over particular. But I was so much displeased, that I
entreated Glumdalclitch to contrive some excuse for not seeing that
young lady any more.
One day a young gentleman, who was a nephew to my nurse's governess,
came and pressed them both to see an execution. It was of a man who
had murdered one of that gentleman's intimate acquaintance.
Glumdalclitch was prevailed on to be of the company, very much against
her inclination, for she was naturally tender-hearted; and as for
myself, although I abhorred such kind of spectacles, yet my
curiosity tempted me to see something that I thought must be
extraordinary. The malefactor was fixed in a chair upon a scaffold
erected for the purpose, and his head cut off at a blow with a sword
of about forty foot long. The veins and arteries spouted up such a
prodigious quantity of blood, and so high in the air, that the great
jet d'eau at Versailles was not equal for the time it lasted; and
the head, when it fell on the scaffold floor, gave such a bounce, as
made me start, although I were at least half an English mile distant.
The Queen, who often used to hear me talk of my sea voyages, and
took all occasions to divert me when I was melancholy, asked me
whether I understood how to handle a sail or an oar, and whether a
little exercise of rowing might not be convenient for my health. I
answered that I understood both very well. For, although my proper
employment had been to be surgeon or doctor to the ship, yet upon a
pinch, I was forced to work like a common mariner. But I could not see
how this could be done in their country, where the smallest wherry was
equal to a first-rate man of war among us, and such a boat as I
could manage would never live in any of their rivers. Her Majesty
said, if I would contrive a boat, her own joiner should make it, and
she would provide a place for me to sail in. The fellow was an
ingenious workman, and by my instructions in ten days finished a
pleasure boat with all its tackling, able conveniently to hold eight
Europeans. When it was finished, the Queen was so delighted, that
she ran with it in her lap to the King, who ordered it to be put in
a cistern full of water, with me in it, by way of trial; where I could
not manage my two sculls, or little oars, for want of room. But the
Queen had before contrived another project. She ordered the joiner
to make a wooden trough of three hundred feet long, fifty broad, and
eight deep; which being well pitched to prevent leaking, was placed on
the floor along the wall, in an outer room of the palace. It had a
cock near the bottom to let out the water when it began to grow stale,
and two servants could easily fill it in half an hour. Here I often
used to row for my own diversion, as well as that of the Queen and her
ladies, who thought themselves well entertained with my skill and
agility. Sometimes I would put up my sail, and then my business was
only to steer, while the ladies gave me a gale with their fans; and
when they were weary, some of the pages would blow my sail forward
with their breath, while I showed my art steering starboard or
larboard as I pleased. When I had done, Glumdalclitch always carried
my boat into her closet, and hung it on a nail to dry.
In this exercise I once met an accident which had like to have
cost me my life. For one of the pages having put my boat into the
trough, the governess who attended Glumdalclitch very officiously
lifted me up to place me in the boat, but I happened to slip through
her fingers, and should have infallibly fallen down forty feet upon
the floor, if by the luckiest chance in the world, I had not been
stopped by a corking-pin that stuck in the good gentlewoman's
stomacher; the head of the pin passed between my shirt and the
waistband of my breeches, and thus I was held by the middle in the air
till Glumdalclitch ran to my relief.
{P_2|CH_5 ^paragraph 10}
Another time, one of the servants, whose office it was to fill my
trough every third day with fresh water, was so careless to let a huge
frog (not perceiving it) slip out of his pail. The frog lay
concealed till I was put into my boat, but then seeking a resting
place, climbed up, and made it lean so much on one side, that I was
forced to balance it with all my weight on the other, to prevent
overturning. When the frog got in, it hopped at once half the length
of the boat, and then over my head, backwards and forwards, daubing my
face and clothes with its odious slime. The largeness of its
features made it appear the most deformed animal that can be
conceived. However, I desired Glumdaclitch to let me deal with it
alone. I banged it a good while with one of my sculls, and at last
forced it to leap out of the boat.
But the greatest danger I ever underwent in that kingdom was from
a monkey, who belonged to one of the clerks of the kitchen.
Glumdalclitch had locked me up in her closet, while she went somewhere
upon business or a visit. The weather being very warm, the closet
window was left open, as well as the windows and the door of my bigger
box, in which I usually lived, because of its largeness and
conveniency. As I sat quietly meditating at my table, I heard
something bounce in at the closet window, and skip about from one side
to the other; whereat, although I was much alarmed, yet I ventured
to look out, but stirred not from my seat; and then I saw this
frolicsome animal, frisking and leaping up and down, till at last he
came to my box, which he seemed to view with great pleasure and
curiosity, peeping in at the door and every window. I retreated to the
farther corner of my room, or box, but the monkey looking in at
every side, put me into such a fright, that I wanted presence of
mind to conceal myself under the bed, as I might easily have done.
After some time spent in peeping, grinning, and chattering, he at last
espied me, and reaching one of his paws in at the door, as a cat
does when she plays with a mouse, although I often shifted place to
avoid him, he at length seized the lappet of my coat (which being made
of that country cloth, was very thick and strong) and dragged me
out. He took me up in his right forefoot, and held me as a nurse
does a child she is going to suckle, just as I have seen the same sort
of creature do with a kitten in Europe: and when I offered to
struggle, he squeezed me so hard, that I thought it more prudent to
submit. I have good to believe that he took me for a young one of
his own species, by his often stroking my face very gently with his
other paw. In these diversions he was interrupted by a noise at the
closet door, as if somebody were opening it; whereupon he suddenly
leaped up to the window at which he had come in, and thence upon the
leads and gutters, walking upon three legs, and holding me in the
fourth, till he clambered up to a roof that was next to ours. I
heard Glumdalclitch give a shriek at the moment he was carrying me
out. The poor girl was almost distracted: that quarter of the palace
was all in an uproar; the servants ran for ladders; the monkey was
seen by hundreds in the court, sitting upon the ridge of a building,
holding me like a baby in one of his fore-paws, and feeding me with
the other, by cramming into my mouth some victuals he had squeezed out
of the bag on one side of his chaps, and patting me when I would not
eat; whereat many of the rabble below could not forbear laughing;
neither do I think they justly ought to be blamed, for without
question the sight was ridiculous enough to everybody but myself. Some
of the people threw up stones, hoping to drive the monkey down; but
this was strictly forbidden, or else very probably my brains had
been dashed out.
The ladders were now applied, and mounted by several men, which
the monkey observing, and finding himself almost encompassed, not
being able to make speed enough with his three legs, let me drop on
a ridge tile, and made his escape. Here I sat for some time three
hundred yards from the ground, expecting every moment to be blown down
by the wind, or to fall by my own giddiness, and come tumbling over
and over from the ridge to the eaves; but an honest lad, one of my
nurse's footmen, climbed up, and putting me into his breeches
pocket, brought me down safe.
I was almost choked with the filthy stuff the monkey had crammed
down my throat: but my dear little nurse picked it out of my mouth
with a small needle, and then I fell to vomiting, which gave me
great relief. Yet I was so weak and bruised in the sides with the
squeezes given me by this odious animal, that I was forced to keep
my bed a fortnight. The King, Queen, and all the court, sent every day
to inquire after my health, and her Majesty made me several visits
during my sickness. The monkey was killed, and an order made that no
such animal should be kept about the palace.
When I attended the King after my recovery, to return him thanks for
his favors, he was pleased to rally me a good deal upon this
adventure. He asked me what my thoughts and speculations were while
I lay in the monkey's paw, how I liked the victuals he gave me, his
manner of feeding, and whether the fresh air on the roof had sharpened
my stomach. He desired to know what I would have done upon such an
occasion my own country. I told his Majesty that in Europe we had no
monkeys, except such as were brought for curiosities from other
places, and so small that I could deal with a dozen of them
together, if they presumed to attack me. And as for that monstrous
animal with whom I was so lately engaged (it was indeed as large as an
elephant), if my fears had suffered me to think so far as to make
use of my hanger (looking fiercely and clapping my hand upon the
hilt as I spoke) when he poked his paw into my chamber, perhaps I
should have given him such a wound, as would have made him glad to
withdraw it with more haste than he put it in. This I delivered in a
firm tone, like a person who was jealous lest his courage should be
called in question. However, my speech produced nothing else besides a
loud laughter, which all the respect due to his Majesty from those
about him could not make them contain. This made me reflect how vain
an attempt it is for a man to endeavor doing himself honor among those
who are out of all degree of equality or comparison with him. And
yet I have seen the moral of my own behavior very frequent in
England since my return, where a little contemptible varlet, without
the least title to birth, person, wit, or common sense, shall
presume to look with importance, and put himself upon a foot with
the greatest persons of the kingdom.
{P_2|CH_5 ^paragraph 15}
I was every day furnishing the court with some ridiculous story; and
Glumdalclitch, although she loved me to excess, yet was arch enough to
inform the Queen, whenever I committed any folly that she thought
would be diverting to her Majesty. The girl, who had been out of
order, was carried by her governess to take the air about an hour's
distance, or thirty miles from town. They alighted out of the coach
near a small footpath in a field, and Glumdalclitch setting down my
traveling box, I went out of it to walk. There was a cow dung in the
path, and I must needs try my activity by attempting to leap over
it. I took a run, but unfortunately jumped short, and found myself
just in the middle up to my knees. I waded through with some
difficulty, and one of the footmen wiped me as clean as he could
with his handkerchief; for I was filthily bemired, and my nurse
confined me to my box till we returned home; where the Queen was
soon informed of what had passed, and the footmen spread it about
the court, so that all the mirth, for some days, was at my expense.

P_2|CH_6
CHAPTER VI
-
I used to attend the King's levee once or twice a week, and had
often seen him under the barber's hand, which indeed was at first very
terrible to behold; for the razor was almost twice as long as an
ordinary scythe. His Majesty, according to the custom of the
country, was only shaved twice a week. I once prevailed on the
barber to give me some of the suds or lather, out of which I picked
forty or fifty of the strongest stumps of hair. I then took a piece of
fine wood, and cut it like the back of a comb, making several holes in
it at equal distance with as small a needle as I could get from
Glumdalclitch. I fixed in the stumps so artificially, scraping and
sloping them with my knife toward the points, that I made a very
tolerable comb; which was a seasonable supply, my own being so much
broken in the teeth, that it was almost useless: neither did I know
any artist in that country so nice and exact, as would undertake to
make me another.
And this puts me in mind of an amusement wherein I spent many of
my leisure hours. I desired the Queen's woman to save for me the
combings of her Majesty's hair, whereof in time I got a good quantity,
and consulting with my friend the cabinet-maker, who had received
general orders to do little jobs for me, I directed him to make two
chair frames, no larger than those I had in my box, and then to bore
little holes with a fine awl round those parts where I designed the
backs and seats; through these holes I wove the strongest hairs I
could pick out, just after the manner of cane chairs in England.
When they were finished, I made a present of them to her Majesty,
who kept them in her cabinet, and used to show them for curiosities,
as indeed they were the wonder of every one that beheld them. The
Queen would have had me sit upon one of these chairs, but I absolutely
refused to obey her, protesting I would rather die a thousand deaths
than place a dishonorable part of my body on those precious hairs that
once adorned her Majesty's head. Of these hairs (as I had always a
mechanical genius) I likewise made a neat little purse about five feet
long, with her Majesty's name deciphered in gold letters, which I gave
to Glumdalclitch, by the Queen's consent. To say the truth, it was
more for show than use, being not of strength to bear the weight of
the larger coins, and therefore she kept nothing in it but some little
toys that girls are fond of.
The King, who delighted in music, had frequent concerts at court, to
which I was sometimes carried, and set in my box on a table to hear
them; but the noise was so great, that I could hardly distinguish
the tunes. I am confident that all the drums and trumpets of a royal
army, beating and sounding together just at your ears, could not equal
it. My practice was to have my box removed from the places where the
performers sat, as far as I could, then to shut the doors and
windows of it, and draw the window curtains; after which I found their
music not disagreeable.
I had learned in my youth to play a little upon the spinet
Glumdaclitch kept one in her chamber, and a master attended twice a
week to teach her: I call it a spinet, because it somewhat resembled
that instrument. and was played upon in the same manner. A fancy
came into my head that I would entertain the King and Queen with an
English tune upon this instrument. But this appeared extremely
difficult; for the spinet was near sixty feet long, each key being
almost a foot wide, so that, with my arms extended, I could not
reach to above five keys, and to press them down required a good smart
stroke with my fist, which would be too great a labor, and to no
purpose. The method I contrived was this. I prepared two round
sticks about the bigness of common cudgels; they were thicker at one
end than the other, and I covered the thicker ends with a piece of a
mouse's skin, that by rapping on them I might neither damage the
tops of the keys, nor interrupt the sound. Before the spinet a bench
was placed, about four feet below the keys, and I was put upon the
bench. I ran sideling upon it that way and this, as fast as I could,
banging the proper keys with my two sticks, and made a shift to play a
jig, to the great satisfaction of both their Majesties: but it was the
most violent exercise I ever underwent, and yet I could not strike
above sixteen keys, nor, consequently, play the bass and treble
together, as other artists do; which was a great disadvantage to my
performance.
The King, who, as I before observed, was a prince of excellent
understanding, would frequently order that I should be brought in my
box, and set upon the table in his closet. He would then command me to
bring one of my chairs out of the box, and sit down within three yards
distance upon the top of the cabinet, which brought me almost to a
level with his face. In this manner I had several conversations with
him. I one day took the freedom to tell his Majesty, that the contempt
he discovered towards Europe, and the rest of the world, did not
seem answerable to those excellent qualities of the mind he was master
of. That reason did not extend itself with the bulk of the body: on
the contrary, we observed in our country that the tallest persons were
usually least provided with it. That among other animals, bees and
ants had the reputation of more industry, art and sagacity, than
many of the larger kinds. And that, as inconsiderable as he took me to
be, I hoped I might live to do his Majesty some signal service. The
King heard me with attention, and began to conceive a much better
opinion of me than he had ever before. He desired I would give him
as exact an account of the government of England as I possibly
could; because, as fond as princes commonly are of their own customs
(for so he conjectured of other monarchs, by my former discourses), he
should be glad to hear of anything that might deserve imitation.
{P_2|CH_6 ^paragraph 5}
Imagine with thyself, courteous reader, how often I then wished
for the tongue of Demosthenes or Cicero, that might have enabled me to
celebrate the praise of my own dear native country in a style equal to
its merits and felicity.
I began my discourse by informing his Majesty that our dominions
consisted of two islands, which composed three mighty kingdoms under
one sovereign, beside our plantations in America. I dwelt long upon
the fertility of our soil, and the temperature of our climate. I
then spoke at large upon the constitution of an English Parliament,
partly made up of an illustrious body called the House of Peers,
persons of the noblest blood, and of the most ancient and ample
patrimonies. I described that extraordinary care always taken of their
education in arts and arms, to qualify them for being counselors
born to the king and kingdom, to have a share in the legislature, to
be members of the highest Court of Judicature, from whence there could
be no appeal, and to be champions always ready for the defense of
their prince and country, by their valor, conduct, and fidelity.
That these were the ornament and bulwark of the kingdom, worthy
followers of their most renowned ancestors, whose honor had been the
reward of their virtue, from which their posterity were never once
known to degenerate. To these we joined several holy persons, as
part of that assembly, under the title of Bishops, whose peculiar
business it is to take care of religion, and of those who instruct the
people therein. These were searched and sought out through the whole
nation, by the prince and his wisest counselors, among such of the
priesthood as were most deservedly distinguished by the sanctity of
their lives, and the depth of their erudition; who were indeed the
spiritual fathers of the clergy and the people.
That the other part of the Parliament consisted of an assembly
called the House of Commons, who were all principal gentlemen,
freely picked and culled out by the people themselves, for their great
abilities and love of their country, to represent the wisdom of the
whole nation. And these two bodies make up the most august assembly in
Europe, to whom, in conjunction with the prince, the whole legislature
is committed.
I then descended to the Courts of justice, over which the judges,
those venerable sages and interpreters of the law, presided, for
determining the disputed rights and properties of men, as well as
for the punishment of vice, and protection of innocence. I mentioned
the prudent management of our treasury; the valor and achievements
of our forces by sea and land. I computed the number of our people, by
reckoning how many millions there might be of each religious sect,
or political party among us. I did not omit even our sports and
pastimes, or any other particular which I thought might redound to the
honor of my country. And I finished all with a brief historical
account of affairs and events in England for about a hundred years
past.
This conversation was not ended under five audiences, each of
several hours, and the King heard the whole with great attention,
frequently taking notes of what I spoke, as well as memorandums of
several questions he intended to ask me.
{P_2|CH_6 ^paragraph 10}
When I had put an end to these long discourses, his Majesty in a
sixth audience, consulting his notes, proposed many doubts, queries,
and objections, upon every article. He asked what methods were used to
cultivate the minds and bodies of our young nobility, and in what kind
of business they commonly spent the first and teachable part of
their lives. What course was taken to supply that assembly when any
noble family became extinct. What qualifications were in those who
were to be created new lords. Whether the humor of the prince, a sum
of money to a court lady, or a prime minister, or a design of
strengthening a party opposite to the public interest, ever happened
to be motives in those advancements. What share of knowledge these
lords had in the laws of their country, and how they came by it, so as
to enable them to decide the properties of their fellow-subjects in
the last resort. Whether they were always so free from avarice,
partialities, or want, that a bribe, or some other sinister view,
could have no place among them. Whether those holy lords I spoke of
were always promoted to that rank upon account of their knowledge in
religious matters, and the sanctity of their lives, had never been
compliers with the times while they were common priests, or slavish
prostitute chaplains to some nobleman, whose opinions they continued
servilely to follow after they were admitted into that assembly.
He then desired to know what arts were practiced in electing those
whom I commoners: whether a stranger with a strong purse might not
influence the vulgar voters to choose him before their own landlord,
or the most considerable gentleman in the neighborhood. How it came to
pass, that people were so violently bent upon getting into this
assembly, which I allowed to be a great trouble and expense, often
to the ruin of their families, without any salary or pension:
because this appeared such an exalted strain of virtue and public
spirit, that his Majesty seemed to doubt it might possibly not be
always sincere: and he desired to know whether such zealous
gentlemen could have any views of refunding themselves for the charges
and trouble they were at, by sacrificing the public good to the
designs of a weak and vicious prince in conjunction with a corrupted
ministry. He multiplied his questions and sifted me thoroughly upon
every part of this head, proposing numberless inquiries and
objections, which I think it not prudent or convenient to repeat.
Upon what I said in relation to our Courts of Justice, his Majesty
desired to be satisfied in several points: and this I was the better
able to do, having been formerly almost ruined by a long suit in
chancery, which was decreed for me with costs. He asked, what time was
usually spent in determining between right and wrong, and what
degree of expense. Whether advocates and orators had liberty to
plead in causes manifestly known to be unjust, vexatious, or
oppressive. Whether party in religion or politics were observed to
be of any weight in the scale of justice. Whether those pleading
orators were persons educated in the general knowledge of equity, or
only in provincial, national, and other local customs. Whether they or
their judges had any part in penning those laws which they assumed the
liberty of interpreting and glossing upon at their pleasure. Whether
they had ever at different times pleaded for and against the same
cause, and cited precedents to prove contrary opinions. Whether they
were a rich or a poor corporation. Whether they received any pecuniary
reward for pleading or delivering their opinions. And particularly
whether they were ever admitted as members in the lower senate.
He fell next upon the management of our treasury; and said he
thought my memory had failed me, because I computed our taxes at about
five or six millions a year, and when I came to mention the issues, he
found they sometimes amounted to more than double; for the notes he
had taken were very particular in this point, because he hoped, as
he told me, that the knowledge of our conduct might be useful to
him, and he could not be deceived in his calculations. But, if what
I told him were true, he was still at a loss how a kingdom could run
out of its estate like a private person. He asked me, who were our
creditors; and where we should find money to pay them. He wondered
to hear me talk of such chargeable and extensive wars; that
certainly we must be a quarrelsome people, or live among very bad
neighbors, and that our generals must needs be richer than our
kings. He asked what business we had out of our own islands, unless
upon the score of trade or treaty, or to defend the coasts with our
fleet. About all, he was amazed to hear me talk of a mercenary
standing army in the midst of peace, and among a free people. He said,
if we were governed by our own consent in the persons of our
representatives, he could not imagine of whom we were afraid, or
against whom we were to fight; and would hear my opinion, whether a
private man's house might not better be defended by himself, his
children, and family, than by half a dozen rascals picked up at a
venture in the streets, for small wages, who might get a hundred times
more by cutting their throats.
He laughed at my odd kind of arithmetic (as he was pleased to call
it) in reckoning the numbers of our people by a computation drawn from
the several sects among us in religion and politics. He said, he
knew no reason, why those who entertain opinions prejudicial to the
public, should be obliged to change, or should not be obliged to
conceal them. And as it was tyranny in any government to require the
first, so it was weakness not to enforce the second: for a man may
be allowed to keep poisons in his closet, but not to vend them about
for cordials.
{P_2|CH_6 ^paragraph 15}
He observed that among the diversions of our nobility and gentry I
had mentioned gaming. He desired to know at what age this
entertainment was usually taken up, and when it was laid down; how
much of their time it employed; whether it ever went so high as to
affect their fortunes; whether mean vicious people, by their dexterity
in that art, might not arrive at great riches, and sometimes keep
our very nobles in dependence, as well as habituate them to vile
companions, wholly take them from the improvement of their minds,
and force them, by the losses they have received, to learn and
practice that infamous dexterity upon others.
He was perfectly astonished with the historical account I gave him
of our affairs during the last century, protesting it was only a
heap of conspiracies, rebellions, murders, massacres, revolutions,
banishments, the very worst effects that avarice, faction,
hypocrisy, perfidiousness, cruelty, rage, madness, hatred, envy, lust,
malice, or ambition could produce.
His Majesty in another audience was at the pains to recapitulate the
sum of all I had spoken, compared the questions he made with the
answers I had given, then taking me into his hands, and stroking me
gently, delivered himself in these words, which I shall never forget
nor the manner he spoke them in: My little friend Grildrig, you have
made a most admirable panegyric upon your country; you have clearly
proved that ignorance, idleness, and vice, may be sometimes the only
ingredients for qualifying a legislator; that laws are best explained,
interpreted, and applied by those whose interest and abilities lie
in perverting, confounding, and eluding them. I observe among you some
lines of an institution, which in its original might have been
tolerable, but these half erased, and the rest wholly blurred and
blotted by corruptions. It does not appear from all you have said, how
any one virtue is required towards the procurement of any one
station among you; much less that men are ennobled on account of their
virtue, that priests are advanced for their piety or learning,
soldiers for their conduct or valor, judges for their integrity,
senators for the love of their country, or counsellors for their
wisdom. As for yourself (continued the King) who have spent the
greatest part of your life in traveling, I am well disposed to hope
you may hitherto have escaped many vices of your country. But by
what I have gathered from your own relation, and the answers I have
with much pains wringed and extorted from you, I cannot but conclude
the bulk of your natives to be the most pernicious race of little
odious vermin that nature ever suffered to crawl upon the surface of
the earth.

CHAPTER VII
-
Nothing but an extreme love of truth could have hindered me from
concealing this part of my story. It was in vain to discover my
resentments, which were always turned into ridicule; and I was
forced to rest with patience while my noble and most beloved country
was so injuriously treated. I am heartily sorry as any of my readers
can possibly be, that such an occasion was given: but this prince
happened to be so curious and inquisitive upon every particular,
that it could not consist either with gratitude or good manners to
refuse giving him what satisfaction I was able. Yet thus much I may be
allowed to say in my own vindication, that I artfully eluded many of
his questions, and gave to every point a more favorable turn by many
degrees than the strictness of truth would allow. For I have always
borne that laudable partiality to my own country, which Dionysius
Halicarnassensis with so much justice recommends to a historian. I
would hide the frailties and deformities of my political mother, and
place her virtues and beauties in the most advantageous light. This
was my sincere endeavor in those many discourses I had with that
mighty monarch, although it unfortunately failed of success.
But great allowances should be given to a King who lives wholly
secluded from the rest of the world, and must therefore be
altogether unacquainted with the manners and customs that most prevail
in other nations; the want of which knowledge will ever produce many
prejudices, and a certain narrowness of thinking, from which we and
the politer countries of Europe are wholly exempted. And it would be
hard indeed, if so remote a prince's notions of virtue and vice were
to be offered as a standard for all mankind.
To confirm what I have now said, and further, to show the
miserable effects of a confined education, I shall here insert a
passage which will hardly obtain belief. In hopes to ingratiate myself
farther into his Majesty's favor, I told him of an invention
discovered between three and four hundred years ago, to make a certain
powder, into a heap of which the smallest spark of fire falling, would
kindle the whole in a moment, although it were as big as a mountain,
and make it all fly up in the air together, with a noise and agitation
greater than thunder. That a proper quantity of this powder rammed
into a hollow tube of brass or iron, according to its bigness, would
drive a ball of iron or lead with such violence and speed, as
nothing was able to sustain its force. the largest balls thus
discharged, would not only destroy whole ranks of an army at once, but
batter the strongest walls to the ground, sink down ships, with a
thousand men in each, to the bottom of the sea; and, when linked
together by a chain, would cut through masts and rigging, divide
hundreds of bodies in the middle, and lay all waste before them.
That we often put this powder into large hollow balls of iron, and
discharged them by an engine into some city we were besieging, which
would rip up the pavements, tear the houses to pieces, burst and throw
splinters on every side, dashing out the brains of all who came
near. That I knew the ingredients very well, which were cheap, and
common; I understood the manner of compounding them, and could
direct his workmen how to make those tubes of a size proportionable to
all other things in his Majesty's kingdom, and the largest need not be
above a hundred feet long; twenty or thirty of which tubes, charged
with the proper quantity of powder and balls, would batter down the
walls of the strongest town in his dominions in a few hours, or
destroy the whole metropolis, if ever it should pretend to dispute his
absolute commands. This I humbly offered to his Majesty, as a small
tribute of acknowledgment in return of so many marks that I had
received of his royal favor and protection.
The King was struck with horror at the description I had given of
those terrible engines, and the proposal I had made. He was amazed how
so impotent and grovelling an insect as I (these were his expressions)
could entertain such inhuman ideas, and in so familiar a manner as
to appear wholly unmoved at all the scenes of blood and desolation,
which I had painted as the common effects of those destructive
machines, whereof he said some evil genius, enemy to mankind, must
have been the first contriver. As for himself, he protested that
although few things delighted him so much as new discoveries in art or
in nature, yet he would rather lose half his kingdom than be privy
to such a secret, which he commanded me, as I valued my life, never to
mention any more.
A strange effect of narrow principles and short views that a
prince possessed of every quality which procures veneration, love, and
esteem; of strong parts, great wisdom, and profound learning, endued
with admirable talents for government, and almost adored by his
subjects, should from a nice unnecessary scruple, whereof in Europe we
can have no conception, let slip an opportunity to put into his hands,
that would have made him absolute master of the lives, the
liberties, and the fortunes of his people. Neither do I say this
with the least intention to detract from the many virtues of that
excellent King, whose character I am sensible will on this account
be very much lessened in the opinion of an English reader: but I
take this defect among them to have risen from their ignorance, they
not having hitherto reduced politics into a science, as the more acute
wits of Europe have done. For I remember very well, in a discourse one
day with the King, when I happened to say there were several
thousand books among us written upon the art of government, it gave
him (directly contrary to my intention) a very mean opinion of our
understandings. He professed both to abominate and despise all
mystery, refinement, and intrigue, either in a prince or a minister.
He could not tell what I meant secrets of state, where an enemy or
some rival nation were not in the case. He confined the knowledge of
governing within very narrow bounds; to common sense and reason, to
justice and lenity, to the speedy determination of civil and
criminal causes; with some other obvious topics, which are not worth
considering. And he gave it for his opinion, that whoever could make
two ears of corn or two blades of grass to grow upon a spot of
ground where only one grew before, would deserve better of mankind,
and do more essential service to his country than the whole race of
politicians put together.
{P_2|CH_7 ^paragraph 5}
The learning of this people is very defective, consisting only in
morality, history, poetry, and mathematics, wherein they must be
allowed to excel. But the last of these is wholly applied to what
may be useful in life, to the improvement of agriculture, and all
mechanical arts; so that among us it would be little esteemed. And
as to ideas, entities, abstractions, and transcendentals, I could
never drive the least conception into their heads.
No law of that country must exceed in words the number of letters in
their alphabet, which consists only of twenty-two. But indeed few of
them extend even to that length. They are expressed in the most
plain and simple terms, wherein those people are not mercurial
enough to discover above one interpretation; and to write a comment
upon any law is a capital crime. As to the decision of civil causes,
or proceedings against criminals, their precedents are so few, that
they have little reason to boast of any extraordinary skill in either.
They have had the art of printing, as well as the Chinese, time
out of mind. But their libraries are not very large; for that of the
King's which is reckoned the biggest, does not amount to above a
thousand volumes, placed in a gallery twelve hundred feet long, from
which I had liberty to borrow what books I pleased. The Queen's joiner
had contrived in one of Glumdalclitch's rooms a kind of wooden machine
twenty-five feet high, formed like a standing ladder; the steps were
each fifty feet long. It was indeed a moveable pair of stairs, the
lowest end placed at ten feet distance from the wall of the chamber.
The book I had a mind to read was put up leaning against the wall. I
first mounted to the upper step of the ladder, and turning my face
towards the book, began at the top of the page, and so walking to
the right and left about eight or ten yards, according to the length
of the lines, till I had gotten a little below the level of my eyes,
and then descending gradually till I came to the bottom; after which I
mounted again and began the other page in the same manner, and so
turned over the leaf, which I could easily do with both my hands,
for it was as thick and stiff as pasteboard, and in the largest folios
not above eighteen or twenty feet long.
Their style is clear, masculine, and smooth, but not florid, for
they avoid nothing more than multiplying unnecessary words, or using
various expressions. I have perused many of their books, especially
those in history and morality. Among the rest, I was much diverted
with a little old treatise, which always lay in Glumdalclitch's bed
chamber, and belonged to her governess, a grave elderly gentlewoman,
who dealt in writings of morality and devotion. The book treats of the
weakness of human kind, and is in little esteem, except among the
women and the vulgar. However, I was curious to see what an author
of that country could say upon such a subject. This writer went
through all the usual topics of European showing how diminutive,
contemptible, and helpless an animal was man in his own nature; how
unable to defend himself from the inclemencies of the air, or the fury
of wild beasts; how much he was excelled by one creature in
strength, by another in speed, by a third in foresight, by a fourth in
industry. He added, that nature was degenerated in these latter
declining ages of the world, and could now produce only small abortive
births in comparison of those in ancient times. He said, it was very
reasonable to think, not only that the species of men were
originally much larger, but also, that there must have been giants
in former ages, which, as it is asserted by history and tradition,
so it has been confirmed by huge bones and skulls casually dug up in
several parts of the Kingdom, far exceeding the common dwindled race
of man in our days. He argued, that the very laws of nature absolutely
required we should have been made in the beginning, of a size more
large and robust, not so liable to destruction from every little
accident of a tile falling from a house, or a stone cast from the hand
of a boy, or of being drowned in a little brook. From this way of
reasoning the author drew several moral applications useful in the
conduct of life, but needless here to repeat. For my own part, I could
not avoid reflecting how universally this talent was spread, of
drawing lectures in morality, or indeed rather matter of discontent
and repining, from the quarrels we raise with nature. And I believe,
upon a strict inquiry, those quarrels might be shown as ill-grounded
among us as they are among that people.
As to their military affairs, they boast that the King's army
consists of a hundred and seventy-six thousand foot, and thirty-two
thousand horse: if that may be called an army which is made up of
tradesmen in the several cities, and farmers in the country, whose
commanders are only the nobility and gentry, without pay or reward.
They are indeed perfect enough in their exercises, and under very good
discipline, wherein I saw no great merit; for how should it be
otherwise, where every farmer is under the command of his own
landlord, and every citizen under that of the principal men in his own
city, chosen after the manner of Venice by ballot?
{P_2|CH_7 ^paragraph 10}
I have often seen the militia of Lorbrulgrud drawn out to exercise
in a great field near the city of twenty miles square. They were in
all not above twenty-five thousand foot, and six thousand horse; but
it was impossible for me to compute their number, considering the
space of ground they took up. A cavalier mounted on a large steed,
might be about a hundred feet high. I have seen this whole body of
horse, upon a word of command, draw their swords at once, and brandish
them in the air. Imagination can figure nothing so grand, so
surprising, and so astonishing. It looked as if ten thousand flashes
of lightning were darting at the same time from every quarter of the
sky.
I was curious to know how this prince, to whose dominions there is
no access from any other country, came to think of armies, or to teach
his people the practice of military discipline. But I was soon
informed, both by conversation and reading their histories. For in the
course of many ages they have been troubled with the same disease to
which the whole race of mankind is subject; the nobility often
contending for power, the people for liberty, and the King for
absolute dominion. All which, however happily tempered by the laws
of the kingdom, have been sometimes violated by each of the three
parties, and have once or more occasioned civil wars, the last whereof
was happily put an end to by this prince's grandfather by a general
composition; and the militia, then settled with common consent, has
been ever since kept in the strictest duty.

CHAPTER VIII
-
I had always a strong impulse that I should some time recover my
liberty, though it was impossible to conjecture by what means, or to
form any project with the least hope of succeeding. The ship in
which I sailed was the first ever known to be driven within sight of
that coast, and the King had given strict orders, that if at any
time another appeared, it should be taken ashore, and with all its
crew and passengers brought in a tumbril to Lorbrulgrud. He was
strongly bent to get me a woman of my own size, by whom I might
propagate the breed: but I think I should rather have died than
undergone the disgrace of leaving a posterity to be kept in cages like
tame canary birds, and perhaps, in time, sold about the kingdom to
persons of quality for curiosities. I was, indeed, treated with much

There is a theory which states that if ever anyone discovers
exactly what the Universe is for and why it is here, it will
instantly disappear and be replaced by something even more
bizarre and inexplicable.
 
=================================================================
There is another theory which states that this has already
happened.
 
=================================================================
Chapter 1
 
The story so far:
 
In the beginning the Universe was created.
 
This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded
as a bad move.
 
Many races believe that it was created by some sort of God,
though the Jatravartid people of Viltvodle VI believe that the
entire Universe was in fact sneezed out of the nose of a being
called the Great Green Arkleseizure.
 
The Jatravartids, who live in perpetual fear of the time they
call The Coming of The Great White Handkerchief, are small blue
creatures with more than fifty arms each, who are therefore
unique in being the only race in history to have invented the
aerosol deodorant before the wheel.
 
However, the Great Green Arkleseizure Theory is not widely
accepted outside Viltvodle VI and so, the Universe being the
puzzling place it is, other explanations are constantly being
sought.
 
For instance, a race of hyperintelligent pan-dimensional beings
once built themselves a gigantic supercomputer called Deep
Thought to calculate once and for all the Answer to the Ultimate
Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything.
 
For seven and a half million years, Deep Thought computed and
calculated, and in the end announced that the answer was in fact
Forty-two - and so another, even bigger, computer had to be built
to find out what the actual question was.
 
And this computer, which was called the Earth, was so large that
it was frequently mistaken for a planet - especially by the
strange ape-like beings who roamed its surface, totally unaware
that they were simply part of a gigantic computer program.
 
And this is very odd, because without that fairly simple and
obvious piece of knowledge, nothing that ever happened on the
Earth could possibly make the slightest bit of sense.
 
Sadly however, just before the critical moment of readout, the
Earth was unexpectedly demolished by the Vogons to make way - so
they claimed - for a new hyperspace bypass, and so all hope of
discovering a meaning for life was lost for ever.
 
Or so it would seem.
 
Two of there strange, ape-like creatures survived.
 
Arthur Dent escaped at the very last moment because an old friend
of his, Ford Prefect, suddenly turned out to be from a small
planet in the vicinity of Betelgeuse and not from Guildford as he
had hitherto claimed; and, more to the point, he knew how to
hitch rides on flying saucers.
 
Tricia McMillian - or Trillian - had skipped the planet six
months earlier with Zaphod Beeblebrox, the then President of the
Galaxy.
 
Two survivors.
 
They are all that remains of the greatest experiment ever
conducted - to find the Ultimate Question and the Ultimate Answer
of Life, the Universe, and Everything.
 
And, less than half a million miles from where their starship is
drifting lazily through the inky blackness of space, a Vogon ship
is moving slowly towards them.
 
=================================================================
Chapter 2
 
Like all Vogon ships it looked as if it had been not so much
designed as congealed. The unpleasant yellow lumps and edifices
which protuded from it at unsightly angles would have disfigured
the looks of most ships, but in this case that was sadly
impossible. Uglier things have been spotted in the skies, but not
by reliable witnesses.
 
In fact to see anything much uglier than a Vogon ship you would
have to go inside and look at a Vogon. If you are wise, however,
this is precisely what you will avoid doing because the average
Vogon will not think twice before doing something so pointlessly
hideous to you that you will wish you had never been born - or
(if you are a clearer minded thinker) that the Vogon had never
been born.
 
In fact, the average Vogon probably wouldn't even think once.
They are simple-minded, thick-willed, slug-brained creatures, and
thinking is not really something they are cut out for. Anatomical
analysis of the Vogon reveals that its brain was originally a
badly deformed, misplaced and dyspeptic liver. The fairest thing
you can say about them, then, is that they know what they like,
and what they like generally involves hurting people and,
wherever possible, getting very angry.
 
One thing they don't like is leaving a job unfinished -
particularly this Vogon, and particularly - for various reasons -
this job.
 
This Vogon was Captain Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz of the Galactic
Hyperspace Planning Council, and he was it who had had the job of
demolishing the so-called "planet" Earth.
 
He heaved his monumentally vile body round in his ill-fitting,
slimy seat and stared at the monitor screen on which the starship
Heart of Gold was being systematically scanned.
 
It mattered little to him that the Heart of Gold, with its
Infinite Improbability Drive, was the most beautiful and
revolutionary ship ever built. Aesthetics and technology were
closed books to him and, had he had his way, burnt and buried
books as well.
 
It mattered even less to him that Zaphod Beeblebrox was aboard.
Zaphod Beeblebrox was now the ex-President of the Galaxy, and
though every police force in the Galaxy was currently pursuing
both him and this ship he had stolen, the Vogon was not
interested.
 
He had other fish to fry.
 
It has been said that Vogons are not above a little bribery and
corruption in the same way that the sea is not above the clouds,
and this was certainly true in his case. When he heard the words
"integrity" or "moral rectitude", he reached for his dictionary,
and when he heard the chink of ready money in large quantities he
reached for the rule book and threw it away.
 
In seeking so implacably the destruction of the Earth and all
that therein lay he was moving somewhat above and beyond the call
of his professional duty. There was even some doubt as to whether
the said bypass was actually going to be built, but the matter
had been glossed over.
 
He grunted a repellent grunt of satisfaction.
 
"Computer," he croaked, "get me my brain care specialist on the
line."
 
Within a few seconds the face of Gag Halfrunt appeared on the
screen, smiling the smile of a man who knew he was ten light
years away from the Vogon face he was looking at. Mixed up
somewhere in the smile was a glint of irony too. Though the Vogon
persistently referred to him as "my private brain care
specialist" there was not a lot of brain to take care of, and it
was in fact Halfrunt who was employing the Vogon. He was paying
him an awful lot of money to do some very dirty work. As one of
the Galaxy's most prominent and successful psychiatrists, he and
a consortium of his colleagues were quite prepared to spend an
awful lot of money when it seemed that the entire future of
psychiatry might be at stake.
 
"Well," he said, "hello my Captain of Vogons Prostetnic, and how
are we feeling today?"
 
The Vogon captain told him that in the last few hours he had
wiped out nearly half his crew in a disciplinary exercise.
 
Halfrunt's smile did not flicker for an instant.
 
"Well," he said, "I think this is perfectly normal behaviour for
a Vogon, you know? The natural and healthy channelling of the
aggressive instincts into acts of senseless violence."
 
"That," rumbled the Vogon, "is what you always say."
 
"Well again," said Halfrunt, "I think that this is perfectly
normal behaviour for a psychiatrist. Good. We are clearly both
very well adjusted in our mental attitudes today. Now tell me,
what news of the mission?"
 
"We have located the ship."
 
"Wonderful," said Halfrunt, "wonderful! and the occupants?"
 
"The Earthman is there."
 
"Excellent! And ...?"
 
"A female from the same planet. They are the last."
 
"Good, good," beamed Halfrunt, "Who else?"
 
"The man Prefect."
 
"Yes?"
 
"And Zaphod Beeblebrox."
 
For an instant Halfrunt's smile flickered.
 
"Ah yes," he said, "I had been expecting this. It is most
regrettable."
 
"A personal friend?" inquired the Vogon, who had heard the
expression somewhere once and decided to try it out.
 
"Ah, no," said Halfrunt, "in my profession you know, we do not
make personal friends."
 
"Ah," grunted the Vogon, "professional detachment."
 
"No," said Halfrunt cheerfully, "we just don't have the knack."
 
He paused. His mouth continued to smile, but his eyes frowned
slightly.
 
"But Beeblebrox, you know," he said, "he is one of my most
profitable clients. He had personality problems beyond the dreams
of analysts."
 
He toyed with this thought a little before reluctantly dismissing
it.
 
"Still," he said, "you are ready for your task?"
 
"Yes."
 
"Good. Destroy the ship immediately."
 
"What about Beeblebrox?"
 
"Well," said Halfrunt brightly, "Zaphod's just this guy, you
know?"
 
He vanished from the screen.
 
The Vogon Captain pressed a communicator button which connected
him with the remains of his crew.
 
"Attack," he said.
 
At that precise moment Zaphod Beeblebrox was in his cabin
swearing very loudly. Two hours ago, he had said that they would
go for a quick bite at the Restaurant at the End of the Universe,
whereupon he had had a blazing row with the ship's computer and
stormed off to his cabin shouting that he would work out the
Improbability factors with a pencil.
 
The Heart of Gold's Improbability Drive made it the most powerful
and unpredictable ship in existence. There was nothing it
couldn't do, provided you knew exactly how improbable it was that
the thing you wanted it to do would ever happen.
 
He had stolen it when, as President, he was meant to be launching
it. He didn't know exactly why he had stolen it, except that he
liked it.
 
He didn't know why he had become President of the Galaxy, except
that it seemed a fun thing to be.
 
He did know that there were better reasons than these, but that
they were buried in a dark, locked off section of his two brains.
He wished the dark, locked off section of his two brains would go
away because they occasionally surfaced momentarily and put
strange thoughts into the light, fun sections of his mind and
tried to deflect him from what he saw as being the basic business
of his life, which was to have a wonderfully good time.
 
At the moment he was not having a wonderfully good time. He had
run out of patience and pencils and was feeling very hungry.
 
"Starpox!" he shouted.
 
At that same precise moment, Ford Prefect was in mid air. This
was not because of anything wrong with the ship's artificial
gravity field, but because he was leaping down the stair-well
which led to the ship's personal cabins. It was a very high jump
to do in one bound and he landed awkwardly, stumbled, recovered,
raced down the corridor sending a couple of miniature service
robots flying, skidded round the corner, burst into Zaphod's door
and explained what was on his mind.
 
"Vogons," he said.
 
A short while before this, Arthur Dent had set out from his cabin
in search of a cup of tea. It was not a quest he embarked upon
with a great deal of optimism., because he knew that the only
source of hot drinks on the entire ship was a benighted piece of
equipment produced by the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation. It was
called a Nutri-Matic Drinks Synthesizer, and he had encountered
it before.
 
It claimed to produce the widest possible range of drinks
personally matched to the tastes and metabolism of whoever cared
to use it. When put to the test, however, it invariably produced
a plastic cup filled with a liquid that was almost, but nit
quite, entirely unlike tea.
 
He attempted to reason with the thing.
 
"Tea," he said.
 
"Share and Enjoy," the machine replied and provided him with yet
another cup of the sickly liquid.
 
He threw it away.
 
"Share and enjoy," the machine repeated and provided him with
another one.
 
"Share and Enjoy" is the company motto of the hugely successful
Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Complaints division, which now
covers the major land masses of three medium sized planets and is
the only part of the Corporation to have shown a consistent
profit in recent years.
 
The motto stands - or rather stood - in three mile high
illuminated letters near the Complaints Department spaceport on
Eadrax. Unfortunately its weight was such that shortly after it
was erected, the ground beneath the letters caved in and they
dropped for nearly half their length through the offices of many
talented young complaints executives - now deceased.
 
The protruding upper halves of the letters now appear, in the
local language, to read "Go stick your head in a pig", and are no
longer illuminated, except at times of special celebration.
 
Arthur threw away a sixth cup of the liquid.
 
"Listen, you machine," he said, "you claim you can synthesize any
drink in existence, so why do you keep giving me the same
undrinkable stuff?"
 
"Nutrition and pleasurable sense data," burbled the machine.
"Share and Enjoy."
 
"It tastes filthy!"
 
"If you have enjoyed the experience of this drink," continued the
machine, "why not share it with your friends?"
 
"Because," said Arthur tartly, "I want to keep them. Will you try
to comprehend what I'm telling you? That drink ..."
 
"That drink," said the machine sweetly, "was individually
tailored to meet your personal requirements for nutrition and
pleasure."
 
"Ah," said Arthur, "so I'm a masochist on diet am I?"
 
"Share and Enjoy."
 
"Oh shut up."
 
"Will that be all?"
 
Arthur decided to give up.
 
"Yes," he said.
 
Then he decided he'd be dammed if he'd give up.
 
"No," he said, "look, it's very, very simple ... all I want ...
is a cup of tea. You are going to make one for me. Keep quiet and
listen."
 
And he sat. He told the Nutri-Matic about India, he told it about
China, he told it about Ceylon. He told it about broad leaves
drying in the sun. He told it about silver teapots. He told it
about summer afternoons on the lawn. He told it about putting in
the milk before the tea so it wouldn't get scalded. He even told
it (briefly) about the history of the East India Company.
 
"So that's it, is it?" said the Nutri-Matic when he had finished.
 
"Yes," said Arthur, "that is what I want."
 
"You want the taste of dried leaves boiled in water?"
 
"Er, yes. With milk."
 
"Squirted out of a cow?"
 
"Well, in a manner of speaking I suppose ..."
 
"I'm going to need some help with this one," said the machine
tersely. All the cheerful burbling had dropped out of its voice
and it now meant business.
 
"Well, anything I can do," said Arthur.
 
"You've done quite enough," the Nutri-Matic informed him.
 
It summoned up the ship's computer.
 
"Hi there!" said the ship's computer.
 
The Nutri-Matic explained about tea to the ship's computer. The
computer boggled, linked logic circuits with the Nutri-Matic and
together they lapsed into a grim silence.
 
Arthur watched and waited for a while, but nothing further
happened.
 
He thumped it, but still nothing happened.
 
Eventually he gave up and wandered up to the bridge.
 
In the empty wastes of space, the Heart of Gold hung still.
Around it blazed the billion pinpricks of the Galaxy. Towards it
crept the ugly yellow lump of the Vogon ship.
 
=================================================================
Chapter 3
 
"Does anyone have a kettle?" Arthur asked as he walked on to the
bridge, and instantly began to wonder why Trillian was yelling at
the computer to talk to her, Ford was thumping it and Zaphod was
kicking it, and also why there was a nasty yellow lump on the
vision screen.
 
He put down the empty cup he was carrying and walked over to
them.
 
"Hello?" he said.
 
At that moment Zaphod flung himself over to the polished marble
surfaces that contained the instruments that controlled the
conventional photon drive. They materialized beneath his hands
and he flipped over to manual control. He pushed, he pulled, he
pressed and he swore. The photon drive gave a sickly judder and
cut out again.
 
"Something up?" said Arthur.
 
"Hey, didja hear that?" muttered Zaphod as he leapt now for the
manual controls of the Infinite Improbability Drive, "the monkey
spoke!"
 
The Improbability Drive gave two small whines and then also cut
out.
 
"Pure history, man," said Zaphod, kicking the Improbability
Drive, "a talking monkey!"
 
"If you're upset about something ..." said Arthur.
 
"Vogons!" snapped Ford, "we're under attack!"
 
Arthur gibbered.
 
"Well what are you doing? Let's get out of here!"
 
"Can't. Computer's jammed."
 
"Jammed?"
 
"It says all its circuits are occupied. There's no power anywhere
in the ship."
 
Ford moved away from the computer terminal, wiped a sleeve across
his forehead and slumped back against the wall.
 
"Nothing we can do," he said. He glared at nothing and bit his
lip.
 
When Arthur had been a boy at school, long before the Earth had
been demolished, he had used to play football. He had not been at
all good at it, and his particular speciality had been scoring
own goals in important matches. Whenever this happened he used to
experience a peculiar tingling round the back of his neck that
would slowly creep up across his cheeks and heat his brow. The
image of mud and grass and lots of little jeering boys flinging
it at him suddenly came vividly to his mind at this moment.
 
A peculiar tingling sensation at the back of his neck was
creeping up across his cheeks and heating his brow.
 
He started to speak, and stopped.
 
He started to speak again and stopped again.
 
Finally he managed to speak.
 
"Er," he said. He cleared his throat.
 
"Tell me," he continued, and said it so nervously that the others
all turned to stare at him. He glanced at the approaching yellow
blob on the vision screen.
 
"Tell me," he said again, "did the computer say what was
occupying it? I just ask out of interest ..."
 
Their eyes were riveted on him.
 
"And, er ... well that's it really, just asking."
 
Zaphod put out a hand and held Arthur by the scruff of the neck.
 
"What have you done to it, Monkeyman?" he breathed.
 
"Well," said Arthur, "nothing in fact. It's just that I think a
short while ago it was trying to work out how to ..."
 
"Yes?"
 
"Make me some tea."
 
"That's right guys," the computer sang out suddenly, "just coping
with that problem right now, and wow, it's a biggy. Be with you
in a while." It lapsed back into a silence that was only matched
for sheer intensity by the silence of the three people staring at
Arthur Dent.
 
As if to relieve the tension, the Vogons chose that moment to
start firing.
 
The ship shook, the ship thundered. Outside, the inch thick
force-shield around it blistered, crackled and spat under the
barrage of a dozen 30-Megahurt Definit-Kil Photrazon Cannon, and
looked as if it wouldn't be around for long. Four minutes is how
long Ford Prefect gave it."Three minutes and fifty seconds," he
said a short while later.
 
"Forty-five seconds," he added at the appropriate time. He
flicked idly at some useless switches, then gave Arthur an
unfriendly look.
 
"Dying for a cup of tea, eh?" he said. "Three minutes and forty
seconds."
 
"Will you stop counting!" snarled Zaphod.
 
"Yes," said Ford Prefect, "in three minutes and thirty-five
seconds."
 
Aboard the Vogon ship, Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz was puzzled. He had
expected a chase, he had expected an exciting grapple with
tractor beams, he had expected to have to use the specially
installed Sub-Cyclic Normality Assert-i-Tron to counter the Heart
of Gold's Infinite Improbability Drive, but the Sub-Cyclic
Normality Assert-i-Tron lay idle as the Heart of Gold just sat
there and took it.
 
A dozen 30-Megahurt Definit-Kil Photrazon Cannon continued to
blaze away at the Heart of Gold, and still it just sat there and
took it.
 
He tested every sensor at his disposal to see if there was any
subtle trickery afoot, but no subtle trickery was to be found.
 
He didn't know about the tea of course.
 
Nor did he know exactly how the occupants of the Heart of Gold
were spending the last three minutes and thirty seconds of life
they had left to spend.
 
Quite how Zaphod Beeblebrox arrived at the idea of holding a
seance at this point is something he was never quite clear on.
 
Obviously the subject of death was in the air, but more as
something to be avoided than harped upon.
 
Possibly the horror that Zaphod experienced at the prospect of
being reunited with his deceased relatives led on to the thought
that they might just feel the same way about him and, what's
more, be able to do something about helping to postpone this
reunion.
 
Or again it might just have been one of the strange promptings
that occasionally surfaced from that dark area of his mind that
he had inexplicably locked off prior to becoming President of the
Galaxy.
 
"You want to talk to your great grandfather?" boggled Ford.
 
"Yeah."
 
"Does it have to be now?"
 
The ship continued to shake and thunder. The temperature was
rising. The light was getting dimmer - all the energy the
computer didn't require for thinking about tea was being pumped
into the rapidly fading force-field.
 
"Yeah!" insisted Zaphod. "Listen Ford, I think he may be able to
help us."
 
"Are you sure you mean think? Pick your words with care."
 
"Suggest something else we can do."
 
"Er, well ..."
 
"OK, round the central console. Now. Come on! Trillian,
Monkeyman, move."
 
They clustered round the central console in confusion, sat down
and, feeling exceptionally foolish, held hands. With his third
hand Zaphod turned off the lights.
 
Darkness gripped the ship.
 
Outside, the thunderous roar of the Definit-Kil cannon continued
to rip at the force-field.
 
"Concentrate," hissed Zaphod, "on his name."
 
"What is it?" asked Arthur.
 
"Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth."
 
"What?"
 
"Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth. Concentrate!"
 
"The Fourth?"
 
"Yeah. Listen, I'm Zaphod Beeblebrox, my father was Zaphod
Beeblebrox the Second, my grandfather Zaphod Beeblebrox the Third
..."
 
"What?"
 
"There was an accident with a contraceptive and a time machine.
Now concentrate!"
 
"Three minutes," said Ford Prefect.
 
"Why," said Arthur Dent, "are we doing this?"
 
"Shut up," suggested Zaphod Beeblebrox.
 
Trillian said nothing. What, she thought, was there to say?
 
The only light on the bridge came from two dim red triangles in a
far corner where Marvin the Paranoid Android sat slumped,
ignoring all and ignored by all, in a private and rather
unpleasant world of his own.
 
Round the central console four figures hunched in tight
concentration trying to blot from their minds the terrifying
shuddering of the ship and the fearful roar that echoed through
it.
 
They concentrated.
 
Still they concentrated.
 
And still they concentrated.
 
The seconds ticked by.
 
On Zaphod's brow stood beads of sweat, first of concentration,
then of frustration and finally of embarrassment.
 
At last he let out a cry of anger, snatched back his hands from
Trillian and Ford and stabbed at the light switch.
 
"Ah, I was beginning to think you'd never turn the lights on,"
said a voice. "No, not too bright please, my eyes aren't what
they once were."
 
Four figures jolted upright in their seats. Slowly they turned
their heads to look, though their scalps showed a distinct
propensity to try and stay in the same place.
 
"Now. Who disturbs me at this time?" said the small, bent, gaunt
figure standing by the sprays of fern at the far end of the
bridge. His two small wispy-haired heads looked so ancient that
it seemed they might hold dim memories of the birth of the
galaxies themselves. One lolled in sleep, but the other squinted
sharply at them. If his eyes weren't what they once were, they
must once have been diamond cutters.
 
Zaphod stuttered nervously for a moment. He gave the intricate
little double nod which is the traditional Betelgeusian gesture
of familial respect.
 
"Oh ... er, hi Great Granddad ..." he breathed.
 
The little old figure moved closer towards them. He peered
through the dim light. He thrust out a bony finger at his great
grandson.
 
"Ah," he snapped. "Zaphod Beeblebrox. The last of our great line.
Zaphod Beeblebrox the Nothingth."
 
"The First."
 
"The Nothingth," spat the figure. Zaphod hated his voice. It
always seemed to him to screech like fingernails across the
blackboard of what he liked to think of as his soul.
 
He shifted awkwardly in his seat.
 
"Er, yeah," he muttered, "Er, look, I'm really sorry about the
flowers, I meant to send them along, but you know, the shop was
fresh out of wreaths and ..."
 
"You forget!" snapped Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth.
 
"Well ..."
 
"Too busy. Never think of other people. The living are all the
same."
 
"Two minutes, Zaphod," whispered Ford in an awed whisper.
 
Zaphod fidgeted nervously.
 
"Yeah, but I did mean to send them," he said. "And I'll write to
my great grandmother as well, just as soon as we get out of this
..."
 
"Your great grandmother," mused the gaunt little figure to
himself.
 
"Yeah," said Zaphod, "Er, how is she? Tell you what, I'll go and
see her. But first we've just got to ..."
 
"Your late great grandmother and I are very well," rasped Zaphod
Beeblebrox the Fourth.
 
"Ah. Oh."
 
"But very disappointed in you, young Zaphod ..."
 
"Yeah well ..." Zaphod felt strangely powerless to take charge of
this conversation, and Ford's heavy breathing at his side told
him that the seconds were ticking away fast. The noise and the
shaking had reached terrifying proportions. He saw Trillian and
Arthur's faces white and unblinking in the gloom.
 
"Er, Great Grandfather ..."
 
"We've been following your progress with considerable despondency
..."
 
"Yeah, look, just at the moment you see ..."
 
"Not to say contempt!"
 
"Could you sort of listen for a moment ..."
 
"I mean what exactly are you doing with your life?"
 
"I'm being attacked by a Vogon fleet!" cried Zaphod. It was an
exaggeration, but it was his only opportunity so far of getting
the basic point of the exercise across.
 
"Doesn't surprise me in the least," said the little old figure
with a shrug.
 
"Only it's happening right now you see," insisted Zaphod
feverishly.
 
The spectral ancestor nodded, picked up the cup Arthur Dent had
brought in and looked at it with interest.
 
"Er ... Great Granddad ..."
 
"Did you know," interrupting the ghostly figure, fixing Zaphod
with a stern look, "that Betelgeuse Five has developed a very
slight eccentricy in its orbit?"
 
Zaphod didn't and found the information hard to concentrate on
what with all the noise and the imminence of death and so on.
 
"Er, no ... look," he said.
 
"Me spinning in my grave!" barked the ancestor. He slammed the
cup down and pointed a quivering, stick-like see-through finger
at Zaphod.
 
"Your fault!" he screeched.
 
"One minute thirty," muttered Ford, his head in his hands.
 
"Yeah, look Great Granddad, can you actually help because ..."
 
"Help?" exclaimed the old man as if he'd been asked for a stoat.
 
"Yeah, help, and like, now, because otherwise ..."
 
"Help!" repeated the old man as if he'd been asked for a lightly
grilled stoat in a bun with French fries. He stood amazed.
 
"You go swanning your way round the Galaxy with your ..." the
ancestor waved a contemptuous hand, "with your disreputable
friends, too busy to put flowers on my grave, plastic ones would
have done, would have been quite appropriate from you, but no.
Too busy. Too modern. Too sceptical - till you suddenly find
yourself in a bit of a fix and come over suddenly all astrally-
minded!"
 
He shook his head - carefully, so as not to disturb the slumber
of the other one, which was already becoming restive.
 
"Well, I don't know, young Zaphod," he continued, "I think I'll
have to think about this one."
 
"One minute ten," said Ford hollowly.
 
Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth peered at him curiously.
 
"Why does that man keep talking in numbers?" he said.
 
"Those numbers," said Zaphod tersely, "are the time we've got
left to live."
 
"Oh," said his great grandfather. He grunted to himself. "Doesn't
apply to me, of course," he said and moved off to a dimmer recess
of the bridge in search of something else to poke around at.
 
Zaphod felt he was teetering on the edge of madness and wondered
if he shouldn't just jump over and have done with it.
 
"Great Grandfather," he said, "It applies to us! We are still
alive, and we are about to lose our lives."
 
"Good job too."
 
"What?"
 
"What use is your life to anyone? When I think of what you've
made of it the phrase `pig's ear' comes irresistibly to my mind."
 
"But I was President of the Galaxy, man!"
 
"Huh," muttered his ancestor, "And what kind of a job is that for
a Beeblebrox?"
 
"Hey, what? Only President you know! Of the whole Galaxy!"
 
"Conceited little megapuppy."
 
Zaphod blinked in bewilderment.
 
"Hey, er, what are you at, man? I mean Great Grandfather."
 
The hunched up little figure stalked up to his great grandson and
tapped him sternly on the knee. This had the effect of reminding
Zaphod that he was talking to a ghost because he didn't feel a
thing.
 
"You know and I know what being President means, young Zaphod.
You know because you've been it, and I know because I'm dead and
it gives one such a wonderfully uncluttered perspective. We have
a saying up here. `Life is wasted on the living.'"
 
"Yeah," said Zaphod bitterly, "very good. Very deep. Right now I
need aphorisms like I need holes in my heads."
 
"Fifty seconds," grunted Ford Prefect.
 
"Where was I?" said Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth.
 
"Pontificating," said Zaphod Beeblebrox.
 
"Oh yes."
 
"Can this guy," muttered Ford quietly to Zaphod, "actually in
fact help us?"
 
"Nobody else can," whispered Zaphod.
 
Ford nodded despondently.
 
"Zaphod!" the ghost was saying, "you became President of the
Galaxy for a reason. Have you forgotten?"
 
"Could we go into this later?"
 
"Have you forgotten!" insisted the ghost.
 
"Yeah! Of course I forgot! I had to forget. They screen your
brain when you get the job you know. If they'd found my head full
of tricksy ideas I'd have been right out on the streets again
with nothing but a fat pension, secretarial staff, a fleet of
ships and a couple of slit throats."
 
"Ah," nodded the ghost in satisfaction, "then you do remember!"
 
He paused for a moment.
 
"Good," he said and the noise stopped.
 
"Forty-eight seconds," said Ford. He looked again at his watch
and tapped it. He looked up.
 
"Hey, the noise has stopped," he said.
 
A mischievous twinkle gleamed in the ghost's hard little eyes.
 
"I've slowed down time for a moment," he said, "just for a moment
you understand. I would hate you to miss all I have to say."
 
"No, you listen to me, you see-through old bat," said Zaphod
leaping out of his chair, "A - thanks for stopping time and all
that, great, terrific, wonderful, but B - no thanks for the
homily, right? I don't know what this great think I'm meant to be
doing is, and it looks to me as if I was supposed not to know.
And I resent that, right?
 
"The old me knew. The old me cared. Fine, so far so hoopy. Except
that the old me cared so much that he actually got inside his own
brain - my own brain - and locked off the bits that knew and
cared, because if I knew and cared I wouldn't be able to do it. I
wouldn't be able to go and be President, and I wouldn't be able
to steal this ship, which must be the important thing.
 
"But this former self of mine killed himself off, didn't he, by
changing my brain? OK, that was his choice. This new me has its
own choices to make, and by a strange coincidence those choices
involve not knowing and not caring about this big number,
whatever it is. That's what he wanted, that's what he got.
 
"Except this old self of mine tried to leave himself in control,
leaving orders for me in the bit of my brain he locked off. Well,
I don't want to know, and I don't want to hear them. That's my
choice. I'm not going to be anybody's puppet, particularly not my
own."
 
Zaphod banged the console in fury, oblivious to the dumbfolded
looks he was attracting.
 
"The old me is dead!" he raved, "Killed himself! The dead
shouldn't hang about trying to interfere with the living!"
 
"And yet you summon me up to help you out of a scrape," said the
ghost.
 
"Ah," said Zaphod, sitting down again, "well that's different
isn't it?"
 
He grinned at Trillian, weakly.
 
"Zaphod," rasped the apparition, "I think the only reason I waste
my breath on you is that being dead I don't have any other use
for it."
 
"OK," said Zaphod, "why don't you tell me what the big secret is.
Try me."
 
"Zaphod, you knew when you were President of the Galaxy, as did
Yooden Vranx before you, that the President is nothing. A cipher.
Somewhere in the shadows behind is another man, being, something,
with ultimate power. That man, or being, or something, you must
find - the man who controls this Galaxy, and - we suspect -
others. Possibly the entire Universe."
 
"Why?"
 
"Why?" exclaimed an astonished ghost, "Why? Look around you lad,
does it look to you as if it's in very good hands?"
 
"It's alright."
 
The old ghost glowered at him.
 
"I will not argue with you. You will simply take this ship, this
Improbability Drive ship to where it is needed. You will do it.
Don't think you can escape your purpose. The Improbability Field
controls you, you are in its grip. What's this?"
 
He was standing tapping at one of the terminals of Eddie the
Shipboard Computer. Zaphod told him.
 
"What's it doing?"
 
"It is trying," said Zaphod with wonderful restraint, "to make
tea."
 
"Good," said his great grandfather, "I approve of that. Now
Zaphod, "he said, turning and wagging a finger at him, "I don't
know if you are really capable of succeeding in your job. I think
you will not be able to avoid it. However, I am too long dead and
too tired to care as much as I did. The principal reason I am
helping you now is that I couldn't bear the thought of you and
your modern friends slouching about up here. Understood?"
 
"Yeah, thanks a bundle."
 
"Oh, and Zaphod?"
 
"Er, yeah?"
 
"If you ever find you need help again, you know, if you're in
trouble, need a hand out of a tight corner ..."
 
"Yeah?"
 
"Please don't hesitate to get lost."
 
Within the space of one second, a bolt of light flashed from the
wizened old ghost's hands to the computer, the ghost vanished,
the bridge filled with billowing smoke and the Heart of Gold
leapt an unknown distance through the dimensions of time and
space.
 
=================================================================
Chapter 4
 
Ten light years away, Gag Halfrunt jacked up his smile by several
notches. As he watched the picture on his vision screen, relayed
across the sub-ether from the bridge of the Vogon ship, he saw
the final shreds of the Heart of Gold's force-shield ripped away,
and the ship itself vanish in a puff of smoke.
 
Good, he thought.
 
The end of the last stray survivors of the demolition he had
ordered on the planet Earth, he thought.
 
The final end of this dangerous (to the psychiatric profession)
and subversive (also to the psychiatric profession) experiment to
find the Question to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe,
and Everything, he thought.
 
There would be some celebration with his fellows tonight, and in
the morning they would meet again their unhappy, bewildered and
highly profitable patients, secure in the knowledge that the
Meaning of Life would not now be, once and for all, well and
truly sorted out, he thought.
 
"Family's always embarrassing isn't it?" said Ford to Zaphod as
the smoke began to clear.
 
He paused, then looked about.
 
"Where's Zaphod?" he said.
 
Arthur and Trillian looked about blankly. They were pale and
shaken and didn't know where Zaphod was.
 
"Marvin?" said Ford, "Where's Zaphod?"
 
A moment later he said:
 
"Where's Marvin?"
 
The robot's corner was empty.
 
The ship was utterly silent. It lay in thick black space.
Occasionally it rocked and swayed. Every instrument was dead,
every vision screen was dead. They consulted the computer. It
said:
 
"I regret that I have been temporarily closed to all
communication. Meanwhile, here is some light music."
 
They turned off the light music.
 
They searched every corner of the ship in increasing bewilderment
and alarm. Everywhere was dead and silent. Nowhere was there any
trace of Zaphod or of Marvin.
 
One of the last areas they checked was the small bay in which the
Nutri-Matic machine was located.
 
On the delivery plate of the Nutri-Matic Drink Synthesizer was a
small tray, on which sat three bone china cups and saucers, a
bone china jug of milk, a silver teapot full of the best tea
Arthur had ever tasted, and a small printed note saying "Wait".
 
=================================================================
Chapter 5
 
Ursa Minor Beta is, some say, one of the most appalling places in
the known Universe.
 
Although it is excruciatingly rich, horrifyingly sunny and more
full of wonderfully exciting people than a pomegranate is of
pips, it can hardly be insignificant that when a recent edition
of Playbeing magazine headlined an article with the words "When
you are tired of Ursa Minor Beta you are tired of life", the
suicide rate quadrupled overnight.
 
Not that there are any nights on Ursa Minor Beta.
 
It is a West Zone planet which by an inexplicable and somewhat
suspicious freak of topography consists almost entirely of sub-
tropical coastline. By an equally suspicious freak of temporal
relastatics, it is nearly always Saturday afternoon just before
the beach bars close.
 
No adequate explanation for this has been forthcoming from the
dominant lifeforms on Ursa Minor Beta, who spend most of their
time attempting to achieve spiritual enlightenment by running
round swimming pools, and inviting Investigation Officials form
the Galactic Geo-Temporal Control Board to "have a nice diurnal
anomaly".
 
There is only one city on Ursa Minor Beta, and that is only
called a city because the swimming pools are slightly thicker on
the ground there than elsewhere.
 
If you approach Light City by air - and there is no other way of
approaching it, no roads, no port facilities - if you don't fly
they don't want to see you in Light City - you will see why it
has this name. Here the sun shines brightest of all, glittering
on the swimming pools, shimmering on the white, palm-lined
boulevards, glistening on the healthy bronzed specks moving up
and down them, gleaming off the villas, the hazy airpads, the
beach bars and so on.
 
Most particularly it shines on a building, a tall beautiful
building consisting of two thirty-storey white towers connected
by a bridge half-way up their length.
 
The building is the home of a book, and was built here on the
proceeds of an extraordinary copyright law suit fought between
the book's editors and a breakfast cereal company.
 
The book is a guide book, a travel book.
 
It is one of the most remarkable, certainly the most successful,
books ever to come out of the great publishing corporations of
Ursa Minor - more popular than Life Begins at Five Hundred and
Fifty, better selling than The Big Bang Theory - A Personal View
by Eccentrica Gallumbits (the triple breasted whore of Eroticon
Six) and more controversial than Oolon Colluphid's latest
blockbusting title Everything You Never Wanted To Know About Sex
But Have Been Forced To Find Out.
 
(And in many of the more relaxed civilizations on the Outer
Eastern Rim of the Galaxy, it has long surplanted the great
Encyclopaedia Galactica as the standard repository of all
knowledge and wisdom, for though it has many omissions and
contains much that is apocryphal, or at least wildly inaccurate,
it scores over the older and more pedestrian work in two
important respects. First, it is slightly cheaper, and secondly
it has the words Don't Panic printed in large friendly letters on
its cover.)
 
It is of course that invaluable companion for all those who want
to see the marvels of the known Universe for less than thirty
Altairan Dollars a day - The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy.
 
If you stood with your back to the main entrance lobby of the
Guide offices (assuming you had landed by now and freshened up
with a quick dip and shower) and then walked east, you would pass
along the leafy shade of Life Boulevard, be amazed by the pale
golden colour of the beaches stretching away to your left,
astounded by the mind-surfers floating carelessly along two feet
above the waves as if it was nothing special, surprised and
eventually slightly irritated by the giant palm trees that hum
toneless nothings throughout the daylight hours, in other words
continuously.
 
If you then walked to the end of Life Boulevard you would enter
the Lalamatine district of shops, bolonut trees and pavement
cafes where the UM-Betans come to relax after a hard afternoon's
relaxation on the beach. The Lalamatine district is one of those
very few areas which doesn't enjoy a perpetual Saturday afternoon
- it enjoys instead the cool of a perpetual early Saturday
evening. Behind it lie the night clubs.
 
If, on this particular day, afternoon, stretch of eveningtime -
call it what you will - you had approached the second pavement
cafe on the right you would have seen the usual crowd of UM-
Betans chatting, drinking, looking very relaxed, and casually
glancing at each other's watches to see how expensive they were.
 
You would also have seen a couple of rather dishevelled looking
hitch-hikers from Algol who had recently arrived on an Arcturan
Megafreighter aboard which they had been roughing it for a few
days. They were angry and bewildered to discover that here,
within sight of the Hitch Hiker's Guide building itself, a simple
glass of fruit juice cost the equivalent of over sixty Altairan
dollars.
 
"Sell out," one of them said, bitterly.
 
If at that moment you had then looked at the next table but one
you would have seen Zaphod Beeblebrox sitting and looking very
startled and confused.
 
The reason for his confusion was that five seconds earlier he had
been sitting on the bridge of the starship Heart of Gold.
 
"Absolute sell out," said the voice again.
 
Zaphod looked nervously out of the corners of his eyes at the two
dishevelled hitch-hikers at the next table. Where the hell was
he? How had he got there? Where was his ship? His hand felt the
arm of the chair on which he was sitting, and then the table in
front of him. They seemed solid enough. He sat very still.
 
"How can they sit and write a guide for hitch-hikers in a place
like this?" continued the voice. "I mean look at it. Look at it!"
 
Zaphod was looking at it. Nice place, he thought. But where? And
why?
 
He fished in his pocket for his two pairs of sunglasses. In the
same pocket he felt a hard smooth, unidentified lump of very
heavy metal. He pulled it out and looked at it. He blinked at it
in surprise. Where had he got that? He returned it to his pocket
and put on the sunglasses, annoyed to discover that the metal
object had scratched one of the lenses. Nevertheless, he felt
much more comfortable with them on. They were a double pair of
Joo Janta 200 Super-Chromatic Peril Sensitive Sunglasses, which
had been specially designed to help people develop a relaxed
attitude to danger. At the first hint of trouble they turn
totally black and thus prevent you from seeing anything that
might alarm you.
 
Apart from the scratch the lenses were clear. He relaxed, but
only a little bit.
 
The angry hitch-hiker continued to glare at his monstrously
expensive fruit juice.
 
"Worst thing that ever happened to the Guide, moving to Ursa
Minor Beta," he grumbled, "they've all gone soft. You know, I've
even heard that they've created a whole electronically
synthesized Universe in one of their offices so they can go and
research stories during the day and still go to parties in the
evening. Not that day and evening mean much in this place."
 
Ursa Minor Beta, thought Zaphod. At least he knew where he was
now. He assumed that this must be his great grandfather's doing,
but why?
 
Much to his annoyance, a thought popped into his mind. It was
very clear and very distinct, and he had now come to recognize
these thoughts for what they were. His instinct was to resist
them. They were the pre-ordained promptings from the dark and
locked off parts of his mind.
 
He sat still and ignored the thought furiously. It nagged at him.
He ignored it. It nagged at him. He ignored it. It nagged at him.
He gave in to it.
 
What the hell, he thought, go with the flow. He was too tired,
confused and hungry to resist. He didn't even know what the
thought meant.
 
=================================================================
Chapter 6
 
"Hello? Yes? Megadodo Publications, home of the Hitch Hiker's
Guide to the Galaxy, the most totally remarkable book in the
whole of the known Universe, can I help you?" said the large
pink-winged insect into one of the seventy phones lined up along
the vast chrome expanse of the reception desk in the foyer of the
Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy offices. It fluttered its wings
and rolled its eyes. It glared at all the grubby people
cluttering up the foyer, soiling the carpets and leaving dirty
handmarks on the upholstery. It adored working for the Hitch
Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy, it just wished there was some way of
keeping all the hitch-hikers away. Weren't they meant to be
hanging round dirty spaceports or something? It was certain that
it had read something somewhere in the book about the importance
of hanging round dirty spaceports. Unfortunately most of them
seemed to come and hang around in this nice clean shiny foyer
after hanging around in extremely dirty spaceports. And all they
ever did was complain. It shivered its wings.
 
"What?" it said into the phone. "Yes, I passed on your message to
Mr Zarniwoop, but I'm afraid he's too cool to see you right now.
He's on an intergalactic cruise."
 
It waved a petulant tentacle at one of the grubby people who was
angrily trying to engage its attention. The petulant tentacle
directed the angry person to look at the notice on the wall to
its left and not to interrupt an important phone call.
 
"Yes," said the insect, "he is in his office, but he's on an
intergalactic cruise. Thank you so much for calling." It slammed
down the phone.
 
"Read the notice," it said to the angry man who was trying to
complain about one of the more ludicrous and dangerous pieces of
misinformation contained in the book.
 
The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy is an indispensable
companion to all those who are keen to make sense of life in an
infinitely complex and confusing Universe, for though it cannot
hope to be useful or informative on all matters, it does at least
make the reassuring claim, that where it is inaccurate it is at
least definitely inaccurate. In cases of major discrepancy it's
always reality that's got it wrong.
 
This was the gist of the notice. It said "The Guide is
definitive. Reality is frequently inaccurate."
 
This has led to some interesting consequences. For instance, when
the Editors of the Guide were sued by the families of those who
had died as a result of taking the entry on the planet Traal
literally (it said "Ravenous Bugblatter beasts often make a very
good meal for visiting tourists" instead of "Ravenous Bugblatter
beasts often make a very good meal of visiting tourists") they
claimed that the first version of the sentence was the more
aesthetically pleasing, summoned a qualified poet to testify
under oath that beauty was truth, truth beauty and hoped thereby
to prove that the guilty party was Life itself for failing to be
either beautiful or true. The judges concurred, and in a moving
speech held that Life itself was in contempt of court, and duly
confiscated it from all those there present before going off to
enjoy a pleasant evening's ultragolf.
 
Zaphod Beeblebrox entered the foyer. He strode up to the insect
receptionist.
 
"OK," he said, "Where's Zarniwoop? Get me Zarniwoop."
 
"Excuse me, sir?" said the insect icily. It did not care to be
addressed in this manner.
 
"Zarniwoop. Get him, right? Get him now."
 
"Well, sir," snapped the fragile little creature, "if you could
be a little cool about it ..."
 
"Look," said Zaphod, "I'm up to here with cool, OK? I'm so
amazingly cool you could keep a side of meat inside me for a
month. I am so hip I have difficulty seeing over my pelvis. Now
will you move before you blow it?"
 
"Well, if you'd let me explain, sir," said the insect tapping the
most petulant of all the tentacles at its disposal, "I'm afraid
that isn't possible right now as Mr Zarniwoop is on an
intergalactic cruise."
 
Hell, thought Zaphod.
 
"When he's going to be back?" he said.
 
"Back sir? He's in his office."
 
Zaphod paused while he tried to sort this particular thought out
in his mind. He didn't succeed.
 
"This cat's on an intergalactic cruise ... in his office?" He
leaned forward and gripped the tapping tentacle.
 
"Listen, three eyes," he said, "don't you try to outweird me. I
get stranger things than you free with my breakfast cereal."
 
"Well, just who do you think you are, honey?" flounced the insect
quivering its wings in rage, "Zaphod Beeblebrox or something?"
 
"Count the heads," said Zaphod in a low rasp.
 
The insect blinked at him. It blinked at him again.
 
"You are Zaphod Beeblebrox?" it squeaked.
 
"Yeah," said Zaphod, "but don't shout it out or they'll all want
one."
 
"The Zaphod Beeblebrox?"
 
"No, just a Zaphod Beeblebrox, didn't you hear I come in six
packs?"
 
The insect rattled its tentacles together in agitation.
 
"But sir," it squealed, "I just heard on the sub-ether radio
report. It said that you were dead ..."
 
"Yeah, that's right," said Zaphod, "I just haven't stopped moving
yet. Now. Where do I find Zarniwoop?"
 
"Well, sir, his office is on the fifteenth floor, but ..."
 
"But he's on an intergalactic cruise, yeah, yeah, how do I get to
him."
 
"The newly installed Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Vertical
People Transporters are in the far corner sir. But sir ..."
 
Zaphod was turning to go. He turned back.
 
"Yeah?" he said.
 
"Can I ask you why you want to see Mr Zarniwoop?"
 
"Yeah," said Zaphod, who was unclear on this point himself, "I
told myself I had to."
 
"Come again sir?"
 
Zaphod leaned forward, conspirationally.
 
"I just materialized out of thin air in one of your cafes," he
said, "as a result of an argument with the ghost of my great
grandfather. No sooner had I got there that my former self, the
one that operated on my brain, popped into my head and said `Go
see Zarniwoop'. I have never heard of the cat. That is all I
know. That and the fact that I've got to find the man who rules
the Universe."
 
He winked.
 
"Mr Beeblebrox, sir," said the insect in awed wonder, "you're so
weird you should be in movies."
 
"Yeah," said Zaphod patting the thing on a glittering pink wing,
"and you, baby, should be in real life."
 
The insect paused for a moment to recover from its agitation and
then reached out a tentacle to answer a ringing phone.
 
A metal hand restrained it.
 
"Excuse me," said the owner of the metal hand in a voice that
would have made an insect of a more sentimental disposition
collapse in tears.
 
This was not such an insect, and it couldn't stand robots.
 
"Yes, sir," it snapped, "can I help you?"
 
"I doubt it," said Marvin.
 
"Well in that case, if you'll just excuse me ..." Six of the
phones were now ringing. A million things awaited the insect's
attention.
 
"No one can help me," intoned Marvin.
 
"Yes, sir, well ..."
 
"Not that anyone tried of course." The restraining metal hand
fell limply by Marvin's side. His head hung forward very
slightly.
 
"Is that so," said the insect tartly.
 
"Hardly worth anyone's while to help a menial robot is it?"
 
"I'm sorry, sir, if ..."
 
"I mean where's the percentage in being kind or helpful to a
robot if it doesn't have any gratitude circuits?"
 
"And you don't have any?" said the insect, who didn't seem to be
able to drag itself out of this conversation.
 
"I've never had occasion to find out," Marvin informed it.
 
"Listen, you miserable heap of maladjusted metal ..."
 
"Aren't you going to ask me what I want?"
 
The insect paused. Its long thin tongue darted out and licked its
eyes and darted back again.
 
"Is it worth it?" it asked.
 
"Is anything?" said Marvin immediately.
 
"What ... do ... you ... want?"
 
"I'm looking for someone."
 
"Who?" hissed the insect.
 
"Zaphod Beeblebrox," said Marvin, "he's over there."
 
The insect shook with rage. It could hardly speak.
 
"Then why did you ask me?" it screamed.
 
"I just wanted something to talk to," said Marvin.
 
"What!"
 
"Pathetic isn't it?"
 
With a grinding of gears Marvin turned and trundled off. He
caught up with Zaphod approaching the elevators. Zaphod span
round in astonishment.
 
"Hey ... Marvin!" he said, "Marvin! How did you get here?"
 
Marvin was forced to say something which came very hard to him.
 
"I don't know," he said.
 
"But ..."
 
"One moment I was sitting in your ship feeling very depressed,
and the next moment I was standing here feeling utterly
miserable. An Improbability Field I expect."
 
"Yeah," said Zaphod, "I expect my great grandfather sent you
along to keep me company."
 
"Thanks a bundle grandad," he added to himself under his breath.
 
"So, how are you?" he said aloud.
 
"Oh, fine," said Marvin, "if you happen to like being me which
personally I don't."
 
"Yeah, yeah," said Zaphod as the elevator doors opened.
 
"Hello," said the elevator sweetly, "I am to be your elevator for
this trip to the floor of your choice. I have been designed by
the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation to take you, the visitor to
the Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy, into these their offices.
If you enjoy your ride, which will be swift and pleasurable, then
you may care to experience some of the other elevators which have
recently been installed in the offices of the Galactic tax
department, Boobiloo Baby Foods and the Sirian State Mental
Hospital, where many ex-Sirius Cybernetics Corporation executives
will be delighted to welcome your visits, sympathy, and happy
tales of the outside world."
 
"Yeah," said Zaphod, stepping into it, "what else do you do
besides talk?"
 
"I go up," said the elevator, "or down."
 
"Good," said Zaphod, "We're going up."
 
"Or down," the elevator reminded him.
 
"Yeah, OK, up please."
 
There was a moment of silence.
 
"Down's very nice," suggested the elevator hopefully.
 
"Oh yeah?"
 
"Super."
 
"Good," said Zaphod, "Now will you take us up?"
 
"May I ask you," inquired the elevator in its sweetest, most
reasonable voice, "if you've considered all the possibilities
that down might offer you?"
 
Zaphod knocked one of his heads against the inside wall. He
didn't need this, he thought to himself, this of all things he
had no need of. He hadn't asked to be here. If he was asked at
this moment where he would like to be he would probably have said
he would like to be lying on the beach with at least fifty
beautiful women and a small team of experts working out new ways
they could be nice to him, which was his usual reply. To this he
would probably have added something passionate on the subject of
food.
 
One thing he didn't want to be doing was chasing after the man
who ruled the Universe, who was only doing a job which he might
as well keep at, because if it wasn't him it would only be
someone else. Most of all he didn't want to be standing in an
office block arguing with an elevator.
 
"Like what other possibilities?" he asked wearily.
 
"Well," the voice trickled on like honey on biscuits, "there's
the basement, the microfiles, the heating system ... er ..."
 
It paused.
 
"Nothing particularly exciting," it admitted, "but they are
alternatives."
 
"Holy Zarquon," muttered Zaphod, "did I ask for an existentialist
elevator?" he beat his fists against the wall.
 
"What's the matter with the thing?" he spat.
 
"It doesn't want to go up," said Marvin simply, "I think it's
afraid."
 
"Afraid?" cried Zaphod, "Of what? Heights? An elevator that's
afraid of heights?"
 
"No," said the elevator miserably, "of the future ..."
 
"The future?" exclaimed Zaphod, "What does the wretched thing
want, a pension scheme?"
 
At that moment a commotion broke out in the reception hall behind
them. From the walls around them came the sound of suddenly
active machinery.
 
"We can all see into the future," whispered the elevator in what
sounded like terror, "it's part of our programming."
 
Zaphod looked out of the elevator - an agitated crowd had
gathered round the elevator area, pointing and shouting.
 
Every elevator in the building was coming down, very fast.
 
He ducked back in.
 
"Marvin," he said, "just get this elevator go up will you? We've
got to get to Zarniwoop."
 
"Why?" asked Marvin dolefully.
 
"I don't know," said Zaphod, "but when I find him, he'd better
have a very good reason for me wanting to see him."
 
Modern elevators are strange and complex entities. The ancient
electric winch and "maximum-capacity-eight-persons" jobs bear as
much relation to a Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Happy Vertical
People Transporter as a packet of mixed nuts does to the entire
west wing of the Sirian State Mental Hospital.
 
This is because they operate on the curios principle of
"defocused temporal perception". In other words they have the
capacity to see dimly into the immediate future, which enables
the elevator to be on the right floor to pick you up even before
you knew you wanted it, thus eliminating all the tedious
chatting, relaxing, and making friends that people were
previously forced to do whist waiting for elevators.
 
Not unnaturally, many elevators imbued with intelligence and
precognition became terribly frustrated with the mindless
business of going up and down, up and down, experimented briefly
with the notion of going sideways, as a sort of existential
protest, demanded participation in the decision-making process
and finally took to squatting in basements sulking.
 
An impoverished hitch-hiker visiting any planets in the Sirius
star system these days can pick up easy money working as a
counsellor for neurotic elevators.
 
At the fifteenth floor the elevator doors opened quickly.
 
"Fifteenth," said the elevator, "and remember, I'm only doing
this because I like your robot."
 
Zaphod and Marvin bundled out of the elevator which instantly
snapped its doors shut and dropped as fast as its mechanism would
take it.
 
Zaphod looked around warily. The corridor was deserted and silent
and gave no clue as to where Zarniwoop might be found. All the
doors that led off the corridor were closed and unmarked.
 
They were standing close to the bridge which led across from one
tower of the building to the other. Through a large window the
brilliant sun of Ursa Minor Beta threw blocks of light in which
danced small specks of dust. A shadow flitted past momentarily.
 
"Left in the lurch by a lift," muttered Zaphod, who was feeling
at his least jaunty.
 
They both stood and looked in both directions.
 
"You know something?" said Zaphod to Marvin.
 
"More that you can possibly imagine."
 
"I'm dead certain this building shouldn't be shaking," Zaphod
said.
 
It was just a light tremor through the soles of his feet - and
another one. In the sunbeams the flecks of dust danced more
vigorously. Another shadow flitted past.
 
Zaphod looked at the floor.
 
"Either," he said, not very confidently, "they've got some vibro
system for toning up your muscles while you work, or ..."
 
He walked across to the window and suddenly stumbled because at
that moment his Joo Janta 200 Super-Chromatic Peril Sensitive
sunglasses had turned utterly black. A large shadow flitted past
the window with a sharp buzz.
 
Zaphod ripped off his sunglasses, and as he did so the building
shook with a thunderous roar. He leapt to the window.
 
"Or," he said, "this building's being bombed!"
 
Another roar cracked through the building.
 
"Who in the Galaxy would want to bomb a publishing company?"
asked Zaphod, but never heard Marvin's reply because at that
moment the building shook with another bomb attack. He tried to
stagger back to the elevator - a pointless manoeuvre he realized,
but the only one he could think of.
 
Suddenly, at the end of the corridor leading at right angles from
this one, he caught sight of a figure as it lunged into view, a
man. The man saw him.
 
"Beeblebrox, over here!" he shouted.
 
Zaphod eyed him with distrust as another bomb blast rocked the
building.
 
"No," called Zaphod, "Beeblebrox over here! Who are you?"
 
"A friend!" shouted back the man. He ran towards Zaphod.
 
"Oh yeah?" said Zaphod, "Anyone's friend in particular, or just
generally well disposed of people?"
 
The man raced along the corridor, the floor bucking beneath his
feet like an excited blanket. He was short, stocky and
weatherbeaten and his clothes looked as if they'd been twice
round the Galaxy and back with him in them.
 
"Do you know," Zaphod shouted in his ear when he arrived, "your
building's being bombed?"
 
The man indicated his awareness.
 
It suddenly stopped being light. Glancing round at the window to
see why, Zaphod gaped as a huge sluglike, gunmetal-green
spacecraft crept through the air past the building. Two more
followed it.
 
"The government you deserted is out to get you, Zaphod," hissed
the man, "they've sent a squadron of Frogstar Fighters."
 
"Frogstar Fighters!" muttered Zaphod, "Zarquon!"
 
"You get the picture?"
 
"What are Frogstar Fighters?" Zaphod was sure he'd heard someone
talk about them when he was President, but he never paid much
attention to official matters.
 
The man was pulling him back through a door. He went with him.
With a searing whine a small black spider-like object shot
through the air and disappeared down the corridor.
 
"What was that?" hissed Zaphod.
 
"Frogstar Scout robot class A out looking for you," said the man.
 
"Hey yeah?"
 
"Get down!"
 
From the opposite direction came a larger black spider-like
object. It zapped past them.
 
"And that was ...?"
 
"A Frogstar Scout robot class B out looking for you."
 
"And that?" said Zaphod, as a third one seared through the air.
 
"A Frogstar Scout robot class C out looking for you."
 
"Hey," chuckled Zaphod to himself, "pretty stupid robots eh?"
 
From over the bridge came a massive rumbling hum. A gigantic
black shape was moving over it from the opposite tower, the size
and shape of a tank.
 
"Holy photon, what's that?"
 
"A tank," said the man, "Frogstar Scout robot class D come to get
you."
 
"Should we leave?"
 
"I think we should."
 
"Marvin!" called Zaphod.
 
"What do you want?"
 
Marvin rose from a pile of rubble further down the corridor and
looked at them.
 
"You see that robot coming towards us?"
 
Marvin looked at the gigantic black shape edging forward towards
them over the bridge. He looked down at his own small metal body.
He looked back up at the tank.
 
"I suppose you want me to stop it," he said.
 
"Yeah."
 
"Whilst you save your skins."
 
"Yeah," said Zaphod, "get in there!"
 
"Just so long," said Marvin, "as I know where I stand."
 
The man tugged at Zaphod's arm, and Zaphod followed him off down
the corridor.
 
A point occurred to him about this.
 
"Where are we going?" he said.
 
"Zarniwoop's office."
 
"Is this any time to keep an appointment?"
 
"Come on."
 
=================================================================
Chapter 7
 
Marvin stood at the end of the bridge corridor. He was not in
fact a particularly small robot. His silver body gleamed in the
dusty sunbeams and shook with the continual barrage which the
building was still undergoing.
 
He did, however, look pitifully small as the gigantic black tank
rolled to a halt in front of him. The tank examined him with a
probe. The probe withdrew.
 
Marvin stood there.
 
"Out of my way little robot," growled the tank.
 
"I'm afraid," said Marvin, "that I've been left here to stop
you."
 
The probe extended again for a quick recheck. It withdrew again.
 
"You? Stop me?" roared the tank. "Go on!"
 
"No, really I have," said Marvin simply.
 
"What are you armed with?" roared the tank in disbelief.
 
"Guess," said Marvin.
 
The tank's engines rumbled, its gears ground. Molecule-sized
electronic relays deep in its micro-brain flipped backwards and
forwards in consternation.
 
"Guess?" said the tank.
 
Zaphod and the as yet unnamed man lurched up one corridor, down a
second and along a third. The building continued to rock and
judder and this puzzled Zaphod. If they wanted to blow the
building up, why was it taking so long?
 
With difficulty they reached one of a number of totally anonymous
unmarked doors and heaved at it. With a sudden jolt it opened and
they fell inside.
 
All this way, thought Zaphod, all this trouble, all this not-
lying-on-the-beach-having-a-wonderful-time, and for what? A
single chair, a single desk and a single dirty ashtray in an
undecorated office. The desk, apart from a bit of dancing dust
and single, revolutionary form of paper clip, was empty.
 
"Where," said Zaphod, "is Zarniwoop?" feeling that his already
tenuous grasp of the point of this whole exercise was beginning
to slip.
 
"He's on an intergalactic cruise," said the man.
 
Zaphod tried to size the man up. Earnest type, he thought, not a
barrel of laughs. He probably apportioned a fair whack of his
time to running up and down heaving corridors, breaking down
doors and making cryptic remarks in empty offices.
 
"Let me introduce myself," the man said, "My name is Roosta, and
this is my towel."
 
"Hello Roosta," said Zaphod.
 
"Hello, towel," he added as Roosta held out to him a rather nasty
old flowery towel. Not knowing what to do with it, he shook it by
the corner.
 
Outside the window, one of the huge slug-like, gunmetal-green
spaceships growled past.
 
"Yes, go on," said Marvin to the huge battle machine, "you'll
never guess."
 
"Errmmm ..." said the machine, vibrating with unaccustomed
thought, "laser beams?"
 
Marvin shook his head solemnly.
 
"No," muttered the machine in its deep guttural rumble, "Too
obvious. Anti-matter ray?" it hazarded.
 
"Far too obvious," admonished Marvin.
 
"Yes," grumbled the machine, somewhat abashed, "Er ... how about
an electron ram?"
 
This was new to Marvin.
 
"What's that?" he said.
 
"One of these," said the machine with enthusiasm.
 
From its turret emerged a sharp prong which spat a single lethal
blaze of light. Behind Marvin a wall roared and collapsed as a
heap of dust. The dust billowed briefly, then settled.
 
"No," said Marvin, "not one of those."
 
"Good though, isn't it?"
 
"Very good," agreed Marvin.
 
"I know," said the Frogstar battle machine, after another
moment's consideration, "you must have one of those new Xanthic
Re-Structron Destabilized Zenon Emitters!"
 
"Nice, aren't they?" said Marvin.
 
"That's what you've got?" said the machine in considerable awe.
 
"No," said Marvin.
 
"Oh," said the machine, disappointed, "then it must be ..."
 
"You're thinking along the wrong lines," said Marvin, "You're
failing to take into account something fairly basic in the
relationship between men and robots."
 
"Er, I know," said the battle machine, "is it ..." it tailed off
into thought again.
 
"Just think," urged Marvin, "they left me, an ordinary, menial
robot, to stop you, a gigantic heavy-duty battle machine, whilst
they ran off to save themselves. What do you think they would
leave me with?"
 
"Oooh, er," muttered the machine in alarm, "something pretty damn
devastating I should expect."
 
"Expect!" said Marvin, "oh yes, expect. I'll tell you what they
gave me to protect myself with shall I@"
 
"Yes, alright," said the battle machine, bracing itself.
 
"Nothing," said Marvin.
 
There was a dangerous pause.
 
"Nothing?" roared the battle machine.
 
"Nothing at all," intoned Marvin dismally, "not an electronic
sausage."
 
The machine heaved about with fury.
 
"Well, doesn't that just take the biscuit!" it roared, "Nothing,
eh? Just don't think, do they?"
 
"And me," said Marvin in a soft low voice, "with this terrible
pain in all the diodes down my left side."
 
"Makes you spit, doesn't it?"
 
"Yes," agreed Marvin with feeling.
 
"Hell that makes me angry," bellowed the machine, "think I'll
smash that wall down!"
 
The electron ram stabbed out another searing blaze of light and
took out the wall next to the machine.
 
"How do you think I feel?" said Marvin bitterly.
 
"Just ran off and left you, did they?" the machine thundered.
 
"Yes," said Marvin.
 
"I think I'll shoot down their bloody ceiling as well!" raged the
tank.
 
It took out the ceiling of the bridge.
 
"That's very impressive," murmured Marvin.
 
"You ain't seeing nothing yet," promised the machine, "I can take
out this floor too, no trouble!"
 
It took out the floor, too.
 
"Hell's bells!" the machine roared as it plummeted fifteen
storeys and smashed itself to bits on the ground below.
 
"What a depressingly stupid machine," said Marvin and trudged
away.
 
=================================================================
Chapter 8
 
"So, do we just sit here, or what?" said Zaphod angrily, "what do
these guys out here want?"
 
"You, Beeblebrox," said Roosta, "they're going to take you to the
Frogstar - the most totally evil world in the Galaxy."
 
"Oh, yeah?" said Zaphod. "They'll have to come and get me first."
 
"They have come and got you," said Roosta, "look out of the
window."
 
Zaphod looked, and gaped.
 
"The ground's going away!" he gasped, "where are they taking the
ground?"
 
"They're taking the building," said Roosta, "we're airborne."
 
Clouds streaked past the office window.
 
Out in the open air again Zaphod could see the ring of dark green
Frogstar Fighters round the uprooted tower of the building. A
network of force beams radiated in from them and held the tower
in a firm grip.
 
Zaphod shook his head in perplexity.
 
"What have I done to deserve this?" he said, "I walk into a
building, they take it away."
 
"It's not what you've done they're worried about," said Roosta,
"it's what you're going to do."
 
"Well don't I get a say in that?"
 
"You did, years ago. You'd better hold on, we're in for a fast
and bumpy journey."
 
"If I ever meet myself," said Zaphod, "I'll hit myself so hard I
won't know what's hit me."
 
Marvin trudged in through the door, looked at Zaphod accusingly,
slumped in a corner and switched himself off.
 
On the bridge of the Heart of Gold, all was silent. Arthur stared
at the rack in front of him and thought. He caught Trillian's
eyes as she looked at him inquiringly. He looked back at the
rack.
 
Finally he saw it.
 
He picked up five small plastic squares and laid them on the
board that lay just in front of the rack.
 
The five squares had on them the five letters E, X, Q, U and I.
He laid them next to the letters S, I, T, E.
 
"Exquisite," he said, "on a triple word score. Scores rather a
lot I'm afraid."
 
The ship bumped and scattered some of the letters for the 'n'th
time.
 
Trillian sighed and started to sort them out again.
 
Up and down the silent corridors echoed Ford Prefect's feet as he
stalked the ship thumping dead instruments.
 
Why did the ship keep shaking? he thought.
 
Why did it rock and sway?
 
Why could he not find out where they were?
 
Where, basically, were they?
 
The left-hand tower of the Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy
offices streaked through interstellar space at a speed never
equalled either before or since by any other office block in the
Universe.
 
In a room halfway up it, Zaphod Beeblebrox strode angrily.
 
Roosta sat on the edge of the desk doing some routine towel
maintenance.
 
"Hey, where did you say this building was flying to?" demanded
Zaphod.
 
"The Frogstar," said Roosta, "the most totally evil place in the
Universe."
 
"Do they have food there?" said Zaphod.
 
"Food? You're going to the Frogstar and you're worried about
whether they got food?"
 
"Without food I may not make it to the Frogstar."
 
Out of the window, they could see nothing but the flickering
light of the force beams, and vague green streaks which were
presumably the distorted shapes of the Frogstar Fighters. At this
speed, space itself was invisible, and indeed unreal.
 
"Here, suck this," said Roosta, offering Zaphod his towel.
 
Zaphod stared at him as if he expected a cuckoo to leap out of
his forehead on a small spring.
 
"It's soaked in nutrients," explained Roosta.
 
"What are you, a messy eater or something?" said Zaphod.
 
"The yellow stripes are high in protein, the green ones have
vitamin B and C complexes, the little pink flowers contain
wheatgerm extracts."
 
Zaphod took and looked at it in amazement.
 
"What are the brown stains?" he asked.
 
"Bar-B-Q sauce," said Roosta, "for when I get sick of wheatgerm."
 
Zaphod sniffed it doubtfully.
 
Even more doubtfully, he sucked a corner. He spat it out again.
 
"Ugh," he stated.
 
"Yes," said Roosta, "when I've had to suck that end I usually
need to suck the other end a bit too."
 
"Why," asked Zaphod suspiciously, "what's in that?"
 
"Anti-depressants," said Roosta.
 
"I've gone right off this towel, you know," said Zaphod handing
it back.
 
Roosta took it back from him, swung himself off the desk, walked
round it, sat in the chair and put his feet up.
 
"Beeblebrox," he said, sticking his hands behind his head, "have
you any idea what's going to happen to you on the Frogstar?"
 
"They're going to feed me?" hazarded Zaphod hopefully.
 
"They're going to feed you," said Roosta, "into the Total
Perspective Vortex!"
 
Zaphod had never heard of this. He believed that he had heard of
all the fun things in the Galaxy, so he assumed that the Total
Perspective Vortex was not fun. He asked what it was.
 
"Only," said Roosta, "the most savage psychic torture a sentinent
being can undergo."
 
Zaphod nodded a resigned nod.
 
"So," he said, "no food, huh?"
 
"Listen!" said Roosta urgently, "you can kill a man, destroy his
body, break his spirit, but only the Total Perspective Vortex can
annihilate a man's soul! The treatment lasts seconds, but the
effect lasts the rest of your life!"
 
"You ever had a Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster?" asked Zaphod
sharply.
 
"This is worse."
 
"Phreeow!" admitted Zaphod, much impressed.
 
"Any idea why these guys might want to do this to me?" he added a
moment later.
 
"They believe it will be the best way of destroying you for ever.
They know what you're after."
 
"Could they drop me a note and let me know as well?"
 
"You know," said Roosta, "you know, Beeblebrox. You want to meet
the man who rules the Universe."
 
"Can he cook?" said Zaphod. On reflection he added:
 
"I doubt if he can. If he could cook a good meal he wouldn't
worry about the rest of the Universe. I want to meet a cook."
 
Roosta sighed heavily.
 
"What are you doing here anyway?" demanded Zaphod, "what's all
this got to so with you?"
 
"I'm just one of those who planned this thing, along with
Zarniwoop, along with Yooden Vranx, along with your great
grandfather, along with you, Beeblebrox."
 
"Me?"
 
"Yes, you. I was told you had changed, I didn't realize how
much."
 
"But ..."
 
"I am here to do one job. I will do it before I leave you."
 
"What job, man, what are you talking about?"
 
"I will do it before I leave you."
 
Roosta lapsed into an impenetrable silence.
 
Zaphod was terribly glad.
 
=================================================================
Chapter 9
 
The air around the second planet of the Frogstar system was stale
and unwholesome.
 
The dank winds that swept continually over its surface swept over
salt flats, dried up marshland, tangled and rotting vegetation
and the crumbling remains of ruined cities. No life moved across
its surface. The ground, like that of many planets in this part
of the Galaxy, had long been deserted.
 
The howl of the wind was desolate enough as it gusted through the
old decaying houses of the cities; it was more desolate as it
whipped about the bottoms of the tall black towers that swayed
uneasily here and there about the surface of this world. At the
top of these towers lived colonies of large, scraggy, evil
smelling birds, the sole survivors of the civilization that once
lived here.
 
The howl of the wind was at its most desolate, however, when it
passed over a pimple of a place set in the middle of a wide grey
plain on the outskirts of the largest of the abandoned cities.
 
This pimple of a place was the thing that had earned this world
the reputation of being the most totally evil place in the
Galaxy. From without it was simply a steel dome about thirty feet
across. From within it was something more monstrous than the mind
can comprehend.
 
About a hundred yards or so away, and separated from it by a
pockmarked and blasted stretch of the most barren land imaginable
was what would probably have to be described as a landing pad of
sorts. That is to say that scattered over a largish area were the
ungainly hulks of two or three dozen crash-landed buildings.
 
Flitting over and around these buildings was a mind, a mind that
was waiting for something.
 
The mind directed its attention into the air, and before very
long a distant speck appeared, surrounded by a ring of smaller
specks.
 
The larger speck was the left-hand tower of the Hitch Hiker's
Guide to the Galaxy office building, descending through the
stratosphere of Frogstar World B.
 
As it descended, Roosta suddenly broke the long uncomfortable
silence that had grown up between the two men.
 
He stood up and gathered his towel into a bag. He said:
 
"Beeblebrox, I will now do the job I was sent here to do."
 
Zaphod looked up at him from where he was sitting in a corner
sharing unspoken thoughts with Marvin.
 
"Yeah?" he said.
 
"The building will shortly be landing. When you leave the
building, do not go out of the door," said Roosta, "go out of the
window."
 
"Good luck," he added, and walked out of the door, disappearing
from Zaphod's life as mysteriously as he had entered it.
 
Zaphod leapt up and tried the door, but Roosta had already looked
it. He shrugged and returned to the corner.
 
Two minutes later, the building crashlanded amongst the other
wreckage. Its escort of Frogstar Fighters deactivated their force
beams and soared off into the air again, bound for Frogstar World
A, an altogether more congenial spot. They never landed on
Frogstar World B. No one did. No one ever walked on its surface
other than the intended victims of the Total Perspective Vortex.
 
Zaphod was badly shaken by the crash. He lay for a while in the
silent dusty rubble to which most of the room had been reduced.
He felt that he was at the lowest ebb he had ever reached in his
life. He felt bewildered, he felt lonely, he felt unloved.
Eventually he felt he ought to get whatever it was over with.
 
He looked around the cracked and broken room. The wall had split
round the door frame, and the door hung open. The window, by some
miracle was closed and unbroken. For a while he hesitated, then
he thought that if his strange and recent companion had been
through all that he had been through just to tell him what he had
told him, then there must be a good reason for it. With Marvin's
help he got the window open. Outside it, the cloud of dust
aroused by the crash, and the hulks of the other buildings with
which this one was surrounded, effectively prevented Zaphod from
seeing anything of the world outside.
 
Not that this concerned him unduly. His main concern was what he
saw when he looked down. Zarniwoop's office was on the fifteenth
floor. The building had landed at a tilt of about forty-five
degrees, but still the descent looked heart-stopping.
 
Eventually, stung by the continuous series of contemptuous looks
that Marvin appeared to be giving him, he took a deep breath and
clambered out on to the steeply inclined side of the building.
Marvin followed him, and together they began to crawl slowly and
painfully down the fifteen floors that separated them from the
ground.
 
As he crawled, the dank air and dust choked his lungs, his eyes
smarted and the terrifying distance down made his heads spin.
 
The occasional remark from Marvin of the order of "This is the
sort of thing you lifeforms enjoy is it? I ask merely for
information," did little to improve his state of mind.
 
About half-way down the side of the shattered building they
stopped to rest. It seemed to Zaphod as he lay there panting with
fear and exhaustion that Marvin seemed a mite more cheerful than
usual. Eventually he realized this wasn't so. The robot just
seemed cheerful in comparison with his own mood.
 
A large, scraggy black bird came flapping through the slowly
settling clouds of dust and, stretching down its scrawny legs,
landed on an inclined window ledge a couple of yards from Zaphod.
It folded its ungainly wings and teetered awkwardly on its perch.
 
Its wingspan must have been something like six feet, and its head
and neck seemed curiously large for a bird. Its face was flat,
the beak underdeveloped, and half-way along the underside of its
wings the vestiges of something handlike could be clearly seen.
 
In fact, it looked almost human.
 
It turned its heavy eyes on Zaphod and clicked its beak in a
desultory fashion.
 
"Go away," said Zaphod.
 
"OK," muttered the bird morosely and flapped off into the dust
again.
 
Zaphod watched its departure in bewilderment.
 
"Did that bird just talk to me?" he asked Marvin nervously. He
was quite prepared to believe the alternative explanation, that
he was in fact hallucinating.
 
"Yes," confirmed Marvin.
 
"Poor souls," said a deep, ethereal voice in Zaphod's ear.
 
Twisting round violently to find the source of the voice nearly
caused Zaphod to fall off the building. He grabbed savagely at a
protruding window fitting and cut his hand on it. He hung on,
breathing heavily.
 
The voice had no visible source whatever - there was no one
there. Nevertheless, it spoke again.
 
"A tragic history behind them, you know. A terrible blight."
 
Zaphod looked wildly about. The voice was deep and quiet. In
other circumstances it would even be described as soothing. There
is, however, nothing soothing about being addressed by a
disembodied voice out of nowhere, particularly if you are, like
Zaphod Beeblebrox, not at your best and hanging from a ledge
eight storeys up a crashed building.
 
"Hey, er ..." he stammered.
 
"Shall I tell you their story?" inquired the voice quietly.
 
"Hey, who are you?" panted Zaphod. "Where are you?"
 
"Later then, perhaps," murmured the voice. "I am Gargravarr. I am
the Custodian of the Total Perspective Vortex."
 
"Why can't I see ..."
 
"You will find your progress down the building greatly
facilitated," the voice lifted, "if you move about two yards to
your left. Why don't you try it?"
 
Zaphod looked and saw a series of short horizontal grooves
leading all the way down the side of the building. Gratefully he
shifted himself across to them.
 
"Why don't I see you again at the bottom?" said the voice in his
ear, and as it spoke it faded.
 
"Hey," called out Zaphod, "Where are you ..."
 
"It'll only take a couple of minutes ..." said the voice very
faintly.
 
"Marvin," said Zaphod earnestly to the robot squatting dejectedly
next to him, "Did a ... did a voice just ..."
 
"Yes," Marvin replied tersely.
 
Zaphod nodded. He took out his Peril Sensitive Sunglasses again.
They were completely black, and by now quite badly scratched by
the unexpected metal object in his pocket. He put them on. He
would find his way down the building more comfortably if he
didn't actually have to look at what he was doing.
 
Minutes later he clambered over the ripped and mangled
foundations of the building and, once more removing his
sunglasses, he dropped to the ground.
 
Marvin joined him a moment or so later and lay face down in the
dust and rubble, from which position he seemed too disinclined to
move.
 
"Ah, there you are," said the voice suddenly in Zaphod's ear,
"excuse me leaving you like that, it's just that I have a
terrible head for heights. At least," it added wistfully, "I did
have a terrible head for heights."
 
Zaphod looked around slowly and carefully, just to see if he had
missed something which might be the source of the voice. All he
saw, however, was the dust, the rubble and the towering hulks of
the encircling buildings.
 
"Hey, er, why can't I see you?" he said, "why aren't you here?"
 
"I am here," said the voice slowly, "my body wanted to come but
it's a bit busy at the moment. Things to do, people to see."
After what seemed like a sort of ethereal sigh it added, "You
know how it is with bodies."
 
Zaphod wasn't sure about this.
 
"I thought I did," he said.
 
"I only hope it's gone for a rest cure," continued the voice,
"the way it's been living recently it must be on its last
elbows."
 
"Elbows?" said Zaphod, "don't you mean last legs?"
 
The voice said nothing for a while. Zaphod looked around
uneasily. He didn't know if it was gone or was still there or
what it was doing. Then the voice spoke again.
 
"So, you are to be put into the Vortex, yes?"
 
"Er, well," said Zaphod with a very poor attempt at nonchalance,
"this cat's in no hurry, you know. I can just slouch about and
take in a look at the local scenery, you know?"
 
"Have you seen the local scenery?" asked the voice of Gargravarr.
 
"Er, no."
 
Zaphod clambered over the rubble, and rounded the corner of one
of the wrecked buildings that was obscuring his view.
 
He looked out at the landscape of Frogstar World B.
 
"Ah, OK," he said, "I'll just sort of slouch about then."
 
"No," said Gargravarr, "the Vortex is ready for you now. You must
come. Follow me."
 
"Er, yeah?" said Zaphod, "and how am I meant to do that?"
 
"I'll hum for you," said Gargravarr, "follow the humming."
 
A soft keening sound drifted through the air, a pale, sad sound
that seemed to be without any kind of focus. It was only by
listening very carefully that Zaphod was able to detect the
direction from which it was coming. Slowly, dazedly, he stumbled
off in its wake. What else was there to do?
 
=================================================================
Chapter 10
 
The Universe, as has been observed before, is an unsettlingly big
place, a fact which for the sake of a quiet life most people tend
to ignore.
 
Many would happily move to somewhere rather smaller of their own
devising, and this is what most beings in fact do.
 
For instance, in one corner of the Eastern Galactic Arm lies the
large forest planet Oglaroon, the entire "intelligent" population
of which lives permanently in one fairly small and crowded nut
tree. In which tree they are born, live, fall in love, carve tiny
speculative articles in the bark on the meaning of life, the
futility of death and the importance of birth control, fight a
few extremely minor wars, and eventually die strapped to the
underside of some of the less accessible outer branches.
 
In fact the only Oglaroonians who ever leave their tree are those
who are hurled out of it for the heinous crime of wondering
whether any of the other trees might be capable of supporting
life at all, or indeed whether the other trees are anything other
than illusions brought on by eating too many Oglanuts.
 
Exotic though this behaviour may seem, there is no life form in
the Galaxy which is not in some way guilty of the same thing,
which is why the Total Perspective Vortex is as horrific as it
is.
 
For when you are put into the Vortex you are given just one
momentary glimpse of the entire unimaginable infinity of
creation, and somewhere in it a tiny little marker, a microscopic
dot on a microscopic dot, which says "You are here."
 
The grey plain stretched before Zaphod, a ruined, shattered
plain. The wind whipped wildly over it.
 
Visible in the middle was the steel pimple of the dome. This,
gathered Zaphod, was where he was going. This was the Total
Perspective Vortex.
 
As he stood and gazed bleakly at it, a sudden inhuman wail of
terror emanated from it as of a man having his soul burnt from
his body. It screamed above the wind and died away.
 
Zaphod started with fear and his blood seemed to turn to liquid
helium.
 
"Hey, what was that?" he muttered voicelessly.
 
"A recording," said Gargravarr, "of the last man who was put in
the Vortex. It is always played to the next victim. A sort of
prelude."
 
"Hey, it really sounds bad ..." stammered Zaphod, "couldn't we
maybe slope off to a party or something for a while, think it
over?"
 
"For all I know," said Gargravarr's ethereal voice, "I'm probably
at one. My body that is. It goes to a lot of parties without me.
Says I only get in the way. Hey ho."
 
"What is all this with your body?" said Zaphod, anxious to delay
whatever it was that was going to happen to him.
 
"Well, it's ... it's busy you know," said Gargravarr hesitantly.
 
"You mean it's got a mind of its own?" said Zaphod.
 
There was a long and slightly chilly pause before Gargravarr
spoke again.
 
"I have to say," he replied eventually, "that I find that remark
in rather poor taste."
 
Zaphod muttered a bewildered and embarrassed apology.
 
"No matter," said Gargravarr, "you weren't to know."
 
The voice fluttered unhappily.
 
"The truth is," it continued in tones which suggested he was
trying very hard to keep it under control, "the truth is that we
are currently undergoing a period of legal trial separation. I
suspect it will end in divorce."
 
The voice was still again, leaving Zaphod with no idea of what to
say. He mumbled uncertainly.
 
"I think we are probably not very well suited," said Gargravarr
again at length, "we never seemed to be happy doing the same
things. We always had the greatest arguments over sex and
fishing. Eventually we tried to combine the two, but that only
led to disaster, as you can probably imagine. And now my body
refuses to let me in. It won't even see me ..."
 
He paused again, tragically. The wind whipped across the plain.
 
"It says I only inhibit it. I pointed out that in fact I was
meant to inhibit it, and it said that that was exactly the sort
of smart alec remark that got right up a body's left nostril, and
so we left it. It will probably get custody of my forename."
 
"Oh ..." said Zaphod faintly, "and what's that?"
 
"Pizpot," said the voice, "My name is Pizpot Gargravarr. Says it
all really doesn't it?"
 
"Errr ..." said Zaphod sympathetically.
 
"And that is why I, as a disembodied mind, have this job,
Custodian of the Total Perspective Vortex. No one will ever walk
on the ground of this planet. Except the victims of the Vortex -
they don't really count I'm afraid."
 
"Ah ..."
 
"I'll tell you the story. Would you like to hear it?"
 
"Er ..."
 
"Many years ago this was a thriving, happy planet - people,
cities shops, a normal world. Except that on the high streets of
these cities there were slightly more shoe shops than one might
have thought necessary. And slowly, insidiously, the numbers of
these shoe shops were increasing. It's a well known economic
phenomenon but tragic to see it in operation, for the more shoe
shops there were, the more shoes they had to make and the worse
and more unwearable they became. And the worse they were to wear,
the more people had to buy to keep themselves shod, and the more
the shops proliferated, until the whole economy of the place
passed what I believe is termed the Shoe Event Horizon, and it
became no longer economically possible to build anything other
than shoe shops. Result - collapse, ruin and famine. Most of the
population died out. Those few who had the right kind of genetic
instability mutated into birds - you've seen one of them - who
cursed their feet, cursed the ground, and vowed that none should
walk on it again. Unhappy lot. Come, I must take you to the
Vortex."
 
Zaphod shook his head in bemusement and stumbled forward across
the plain.
 
"And you," he said, "you come from this hellhole pit do you?"
 
"No no," said Gargravarr, taken aback, "I come from the Frogstar
World C. Beautiful place. Wonderful fishing. I flit back there in
the evenings. Though all I can do now is watch. The Total
Perspective Vortex is the only thing on this planet with any
function. It was built here because no one else wanted it on
their doorstep."
 
At that moment another dismal scream rent the air and Zaphod
shuddered.
 
"What can do that to a guy?" he breathed.
 
"The Universe," said Gargravarr simply, "the whole infinite
Universe. The infinite suns, the infinite distances between them,
and yourself an invisible dot on an invisible dot, infinitely
small."
 
"Hey, I'm Zaphod Beeblebrox, man, you know," muttered Zaphod
trying to flap the last remnants of his ego.
 
Gargravarr made no reply, but merely resumed his mournful humming
till they reached the tarnished steel dome in the middle of the
plain.
 
As they reached it, a door hummed open in the side, revealing a
small darkened chamber within.
 
"Enter," said Gargravarr.
 
Zaphod started with fear.
 
"Hey, what, now?" he said.
 
"Now."
 
Zaphod peered nervously inside. The chamber was very small. It
was steel-lined and there was hardly space in it for more than
one man.
 
"It ... er ... it doesn't look like any kind of Vortex to me,"
said Zaphod.
 
"It isn't," said Gargravarr, "it's just the elevator. Enter."
 
With infinite trepidation Zaphod stepped into it. He was aware of
Gargravarr being in the elevator with him, though the disembodied
man was not for the moment speaking.
 
The elevator began its descent.
 
"I must get myself into the right frame of mind for this,"
muttered Zaphod.
 
"There is no right frame of mind," said Gargravarr sternly.
 
"You really know how to make a guy feel inadequate."
 
"I don't. The Vortex does."
 
At the bottom of the shaft, the rear of the elevator opened up
and Zaphod stumbled out into a smallish, functional, steel-lined
chamber.
 
At the far side of it stood a single upright steel box, just
large enough for a man to stand in.
 
It was that simple.
 
It connected to a small pile of components and instruments via a
single thick wire.
 
"Is that it?" said Zaphod in surprise.
 
"That is it."
 
Didn't look too bad, thought Zaphod.
 
"And I get in there do I?" said Zaphod.
 
"You get in there," said Gargravarr, "and I'm afraid you must do
it now."
 
"OK, OK," said Zaphod.
 
He opened the door of the box and stepped in.
 
Inside the box he waited.
 
After five seconds there was a click, and the entire Universe was
there in the box with him.
 
=================================================================
Chapter 11
 
The Total Perspective Vortex derives its picture of the whole
Universe on the principle of extrapolated matter analyses.
 
To explain - since every piece of matter in the Universe is in
some way affected by every other piece of matter in the Universe,
it is in theory possible to extrapolate the whole of creation -
every sun, every planet, their orbits, their composition and
their economic and social history from, say, one small piece of
fairy cake.
 
The man who invented the Total Perspective Vortex did so
basically in order to annoy his wife.
 
Trin Tragula - for that was his name - was a dreamer, a thinker,
a speculative philosopher or, as his wife would have it, an
idiot.
 
And she would nag him incessantly about the utterly inordinate
amount of time he spent staring out into space, or mulling over
the mechanics of safety pins, or doing spectrographic analyses of
pieces of fairy cake.
 
"Have some sense of proportion!" she would say, sometimes as
often as thirty-eight times in a single day.
 
And so he built the Total Perspective Vortex - just to show her.
 
And into one end he plugged the whole of reality as extrapolated
from a piece of fairy cake, and into the other end he plugged his
wife: so that when he turned it on she saw in one instant the
whole infinity of creation and herself in relation to it.
 
To Trin Tragula's horror, the shock completely annihilated her
brain; but to his satisfaction he realized that he had proved
conclusively that if life is going to exist in a Universe of this
size, then the one thing it cannot afford to have is a sense of
proportion.
 
The door of the Vortex swung open.
 
From his disembodied mind Gargravarr watched dejectedly. He had
rather liked Zaphod Beeblebrox in a strange sort of way. He was
clearly a man of many qualities, even if they were mostly bad
ones.
 
He waited for him to flop forwards out of the box, as they all
did.
 
Instead, he stepped out.
 
"Hi!" he said.
 
"Beeblebrox ..." gasped Gargravarr's mind in amazement.
 
"Could I have a drink please?" said Zaphod.
 
"You ... you ... have been in the Vortex?" stammered Gargravarr.
 
"You saw me, kid."
 
"And it was working?"
 
"Sure was."
 
"And you saw the whole infinity of creation?"
 
"Sure. Really neat place, you know that?"
 
Gargravarr's mind was reeling in astonishment. Had his body been
with him it would have sat down heavily with its mouth hanging
open.
 
"And you saw yourself," said Gargravarr, "in relation to it all?"
 
"Oh, yeah, yeah."
 
"But ... what did you experience?"
 
Zaphod shrugged smugly.
 
"It just told me what I knew all the time. I'm a really terrific
and great guy. Didn't I tell you, baby, I'm Zaphod Beeblebrox!"
 
His gaze passed over the machinery which powered the vortex and
suddenly stopped, startled.
 
He breathed heavily.
 
"Hey," he said, "is that really a piece of fairy cake?"
 
He ripped the small piece of confectionery from the sensors with
which it was surrounded.
 
"If I told you how much I needed this," he said ravenously, "I
wouldn't have time to eat it."
 
He ate it.
 
=================================================================
Chapter 12
 
 A short while later he was running across the plain in the
direction of the ruined city.
 
The dank air wheezed heavily in his lungs and he frequently
stumbled with the exhaustion he was still feeling. Night was
beginning to fall too, and the rough ground was treacherous.
 
The elation of his recent experience was still with him though.
The whole Universe. He had seen the whole Universe stretching to
infinity around him - everything. And with it had come the clear
and extraordinary knowledge that he was the most important thing
in it. Having a conceited ego is one thing. Actually being told
by a machine is another.
 
He didn't have time to reflect on this matter.
 
Gargravarr had told him that he would have to alert his masters
as to what had happened, but that he was prepared to leave a
decent interval before doing so. Enough time for Zaphod to make a
break and find somewhere to hide.
 
What he was going to do he didn't know, but feeling that he was
the most important person in the Universe gave him the confidence
to believe that something would turn up.
 
Nothing else on this blighted planet could give him much grounds
for optimism.
 
He ran on, and soon reached the outskirts of the abandoned city.
 
He walked along cracked and gaping roads riddled with scrawny
weeds, the holes filled with rotting shoes. The buildings he
passed were so crumbled and decrepit he thought it unsafe to
enter any of them. Where could he hide? He hurried on.
 
After a while the remains of a wide sweeping road led off from
the one down which he was walking, and at its end lay a vast low
building, surrounded with sundry smaller ones, the whole
surrounded by the remains of a perimeter barrier. The large main
building still seemed reasonably solid, and Zaphod turned off to
see if it might provide him with ... well with anything.
 
He approached the building. Along one side of it - the front it
would seem since it faced a wide concreted apron area - were
three gigantic doors, maybe sixty feet high. The far one of these
was open, and towards this, Zaphod ran.
 
Inside, all was gloom, dust and confusion. Giant cobwebs lay over
everything. Part of the infrastructure of the building had
collapsed, part of the rear wall had caved in, and a thick
choking dust lay inches over the floor.
 
Through the heavy gloom huge shapes loomed, covered with debris.
 
The shapes were sometimes cylindrical, sometimes bulbous,
sometimes like eggs, or rather cracked eggs. Most of them were
split open or falling apart, some were mere skeletons.
 
They were all spacecraft, all derelict.
 
Zaphod wandered in frustration among the hulks. There was nothing
here that remotely approached the serviceable. Even the mere
vibration of his footsteps caused one precarious wreck to
collapse further into itself.
 
Towards the rear of the building lay one old ship, slightly
larger than the others, and buried beneath even deeper piles of
dust and cobwebs. Its outline, however, seemed unbroken. Zaphod
approached it with interest, and as he did so, he tripped over an
old feedline.
 
He tried to toss the feedline aside, and to his surprise
discovered that it was still connected to the ship.
 
To his utter astonishment he realized that the feedline was also
humming slightly.
 
He stared at the ship in disbelief, and then back down at the
feedline in his hands.
 
He tore off his jacket and threw it aside. Crawling along on his
hands and knees he followed the feedline to the point where it
connected with the ship. The connection was sound, and the slight
humming vibration was more distinct.
 
His heart was beating fast. He wiped away some grime and laid an
ear against the ship's side. He could only hear a faint,
indeterminate noise.
 
He rummaged feverishly amongst the debris lying on the floor all
about him and found a short length of tubing, and a non-
biodegradable plastic cup. Out of this he fashioned a crude
stethoscope and placed it against the side of the ship.
 
What he heard made his brains turn somersaults.
 
The voice said:
 
"Transtellar Cruise Lines would like to apologize to passengers
for the continuing delay to this flight. We are currently
awaiting the loading of our complement of small lemon-soaked
paper napkins for your comfort, refreshment and hygiene during
the journey. Meanwhile we thank you for your patience. The cabin
crew will shortly be serving coffee and biscuits again."
 
Zaphod staggered backwards, staring wildly at the ship.
 
He walked around for a few moments in a daze. In so doing he
suddenly caught sight of a giant departure board still hanging,
but by only one support, from the ceiling above him. It was
covered with grime, but some of the figures were still
discernible.
 
Zaphod's eyes searched amongst the figures, then made some brief
calculations. His eyes widened.
 
"Nine hundred years ..." he breathed to himself. That was how
late the ship was.
 
Two minutes later he was on board.
 
As he stepped out of the airlock, the air that greeted him was
cool and fresh - the air conditioning was still working.
 
The lights were still on.
 
He moved out of the small entrance chamber into a short narrow
corridor and stepped nervously down it.
 
Suddenly a door opened and a figure stepped out in front of him.
 
"Please return to your seat sir," said the android stewardess
and, turning her back on him, she walked on down the corridor in
front of him.
 
When his heart had started beating again he followed her. She
opened the door at the end of the corridor and walked through.
 
He followed her through the door.
 
They were now in the passenger compartment and Zaphod's heart
stopped still again for a moment.
 
In every seat sat a passenger, strapped into his or her seat.
 
The passengers' hair was long and unkempt, their fingernails were
long, the men wore beards.
 
All of them were quite clearly alive - but sleeping.
 
Zaphod had the creeping horrors.
 
He walked slowly down the aisle as in a dream. By the time he was
half-way down the aisle, the stewardess had reached the other
end. She turned and spoke.
 
"Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen," she said sweetly, "Thank
you for bearing with us during this slight delay. We will be
taking off as soon as we possibly can. If you would like to wake
up now I will serve you coffee and biscuits."
 
There was a slight hum.
 
At that moment, all the passengers awoke.
 
They awoke screaming and clawing at their straps and life support
systems that held them tightly in their seats. They screamed and
bawled and hollered till Zaphod thought his ears would shatter.
 
They struggled and writhed as the stewardess patiently moved up
the aisle placing a small cup of coffee and a packet of biscuits
in front of each one of them.
 
Then one of them rose from his seat.
 
He turned and looked at Zaphod.
 
Zaphod's skin was crawling all over his body as if it was trying
to get off. He turned and ran from the bedlam.
 
He plunged through the door and back into the corridor.
 
The man pursued him.
 
He raced in a frenzy to the end of the corridor, through the
entrance chamber and beyond. He arrived on the flight deck,
slammed and bolted the door behind him. He leant back against the
door breathing hard.
 
Within seconds, a hand started beating on the door.
 
From somewhere on the flight deck a metallic voice addressed him.
 
"Passengers are not allowed on the flight deck. Please return to
your seat, and wait for the ship to take off. Coffee and biscuits
are being served. This is your autopilot speaking. Please return
to your seat."
 
Zaphod said nothing. He breathed hard, behind him, the hand
continued to knock on the door.
 
"Please return to your seat," repeated the autopilot. "Passengers
are not allowed on the flight deck."
 
"I'm not a passenger," panted Zaphod.
 
"Please return to your seat."
 
"I am not a passenger!" shouted Zaphod again.
 
"Please return to your seat."
 
"I am not a ... hello, can you hear me?"
 
"Please return to your seat."
 
You're the autopilot?" said Zaphod.
 
"Yes," said the voice from the flight console.
 
"You're in charge of this ship?"
 
"Yes," said the voice again, "there has been a delay. Passengers
are to be kept temporarily in suspended animation, for their
comfort and convenience. Coffee and biscuits are being served
every year, after which passengers are returned to suspended
animation for their continued comfort and convenience. Departure
will take place when the flight stores are complete. We apologize
for the delay."
 
Zaphod moved away from the door, on which the pounding had now
ceased. He approached the flight console.
 
"Delay?" he cried, "Have you seen the world outside this ship?
It's a wasteland, a desert. Civilization's been and gone, man.
There are no lemon-soaked paper napkins on the way from
anywhere!"
 
"The statistical likelihood," continued the autopilot primly, "is
that other civilizations will arise. There will one day be
lemon-soaked paper napkins. Till then there will be a short
delay. Please return to your seat."
 
"But ..."
 
But at that moment the door opened. Zaphod span round to see the
man who had pursued him standing there. He carried a large
briefcase. He was smartly dressed, and his hair was short. He had
no beard and no long fingernails.
 
"Zaphod Beeblebrox," he said, "My name is Zarniwoop. I believe
you wanted to see me."
 
Zaphod Beeblebrox wittered. His mouths said foolish things. He
dropped into a chair.
 
"Oh man, oh man, where did you spring from?" he said.
 
"I've been waiting here for you," he said in a businesslike tone.
 
He put the briefcase down and sat in another chair.
 
"I am glad you followed instructions," he said, "I was a bit
nervous that you might have left my office by the door rather
than the window. Then you would have been in trouble."
 
Zaphod shook his heads at him and burbled.
 
"When you entered the door of my office, you entered my
electronically synthesized Universe," he explained, "if you had
left by the door you would have been back in the real one. The
artificial one works from here."
 
He patted the briefcase smugly.
 
Zaphod glared at him with resentment and loathing.
 
"What's the difference?" he muttered.
 
"Nothing," said Zarniwoop, "they are identical. Oh - except that
I think the Frogstar Fighters are grey in the real Universe."
 
"What's going on?" spat Zaphod.
 
"Simple," said Zarniwoop. His self assurance and smugness made
Zaphod seethe.
 
"Very simple," repeated Zarniwoop, "I discovered the coordinated
at which this man could be found - the man who rules the
Universe, and discovered that his world was protected by an
Unprobability field. To protect my secret - and myself - I
retreated to the safety of this totally artificial Universe and
hid myself away in a forgotten cruise liner. I was secure.
Meanwhile, you and I ..."
 
"You and I?" said Zaphod angrily, "you mean I knew you?"
 
"Yes," said Zarniwoop, "we knew each other well."
 
"I had no taste," said Zaphod and resumed a sullen silence.
 
"Meanwhile, you and I arranged that you would steal the
Improbability Drive ship - the only one which could reach the
ruler's world - and bring it to me here. This you have now done I
trust, and I congratulate you." He smiled a tight little smile
which Zaphod wanted to hit with a brick.
 
"Oh, and in case you were wondering," added Zarniwoop, "this
Universe was created specifically for you to come to. You are
therefore the most important person in this Universe. You would
never," he said with an even more brickable smile, "have survived
the Total Perspective Vortex in the real one. Shall we go?"
 
"Where?" said Zaphod sullenly. He felt collapsed.
 
"To your ship. The Heart of Gold. You did bring it I trust?"
 
"No."
 
"Where is your jacket?"
 
Zaphod looked at him in mystification.
 
"My jacket? I took it off. It's outside."
 
"Good, we will go and find it."
 
Zarniwoop stood up and gestured to Zaphod to follow him.
 
Out in the entrance chamber again, they could hear the screams of
the passengers being fed coffee and biscuits.
 
"It has not been a pleasant experience waiting for you," said
Zarniwoop.
 
"Not pleasant for you!" bawled Zaphod, "How do you think ..."
 
Zarniwoop held up a silencing finger as the hatchway swung open.
A few feet away from them they could see Zaphod's jacket lying in
the debris.
 
"A very remarkable and very powerful ship," said Zarniwoop,
"watch."
 
As they watched, the pocket on the jacket suddenly bulged. It
split, it ripped. The small metal model of the Heart of Gold that
Zaphod had been bewildered to discover in his pocket was growing.
 
It grew, it continued to grow. It reached, after two minutes, its
full size.
 
"At an Improbability Level," said Zarniwoop, "of ... oh I don't
know, but something very large."
 
Zaphod swayed.
 
"You mean I had it with me all the time?"
 
"Zarniwoop smiled. He lifted up his briefcase and opened it.
 
He twisted a single switch inside it.
 
"Goodbye artificial Universe," he said, "hello real one!"
 
The scene before them shimmered briefly - and reappeared exactly
as before.
 
"You see?" said Zarniwoop, "exactly the same."
 
 "You mean," repeated Zaphod tautly, "that I had it with me all
the time?"
 
"Oh yes," said Zarniwoop, "of course. That was the whole point."
 
"That's it," said Zaphod, "you can count me out, from hereon in
you can count me out. I've had all I want of this. You play your
own games."
 
"I'm afraid you cannot leave," said Zarniwoop, "you are entwined
in the Improbability field. You cannot escape."
 
He smiled the smile that Zaphod had wanted to hit and this time
Zaphod hit it.
 
=================================================================
Chapter 13
 
Ford Prefect bounded up to the bridge of the Heart of Gold.
 
"Trillian! Arthur!" he shouted, "it's working! The ship's
reactivated!"
 
Trillian and Arthur were asleep on the floor.
 
"Come on you guys, we're going off, we're off," he said kicking
them awake.
 
"Hi there guys!" twittered the computer, "it's really great to be
back with you again, I can tell you, and I just want to say that
..."
 
"Shut up," said Ford, "tell us where the hell we are."
 
"Frogstar World B, and man it's a dump," said Zaphod running on
to the bridge, "hi, guys, you must be so amazingly glad to see me
you don't even find words to tell me what a cool frood I am."
 
"What a what?" said Arthur blearily, picking himself up from the
floor and not taking any of this in.
 
"I know how you feel," said Zaphod, "I'm so great even I get
tongue-tied talking to myself. Hey it's good to see you Trillian,
Ford, Monkeyman. Hey, er, computer ...?"
 
"Hi there, Mr Beeblebrox sir, sure is a great honor to ..."
 
"Shut up and get us out of here, fast fast fast."
 
"Sure thing, fella, where do you want to go?"
 
"Anywhere, doesn't matter," shouted Zaphod, "yes it does!" he
said again, "we want to go to the nearest place to eat!"
 
"Sure thing," said the computer happily and a massive explosion
rocket the bridge.
 
When Zarniwoop entered a minute or so later with a black eye, he
regarded the four wisps of smoke with interest.
 
=================================================================
Chapter 14
 
Four inert bodies sank through spinning blackness. Consciousness
had died, cold oblivion pulled the bodies down and down into the
pit of unbeing. The roar of silence echoed dismally around them
and they sank at last into a dark and bitter sea of heaving red
that slowly engulfed them, seemingly for ever.
 
After what seemed an eternity the sea receded and left them lying
on a cold hard shore, the flotsam and jetsam of the stream of
Life, the Universe, and Everything.
 
Cold spasms shook them, lights danced sickeningly around them.
The cold hard shore tipped and span and then stood still. It
shone darkly - it was a very highly polished cold hard shore.
 
A green blur watched them disapprovingly.
 
It coughed.
 
"Good evening, madam, gentlemen," it said, "do you have a
reservation?"
 
Ford Prefect's consciousness snapped back like elastic, making
his brain smart. He looked up woozily at the green blur.
 
"Reservation?" he said weakly. "Yes, sir," said the green blur.
 
"Do you need a reservation for the afterlife?"
 
In so far as it is possible for a green blur to arch its eyebrows
disdainfully, this is what the green blur now did.
 
"Afterlife, sir?" it said.
 
Arthur Dent was grappling with his consciousness the way one
grapples with a lost bar of soap in the bath.
 
"Is this the afterlife?" he stammered.
 
"Well I assume so," said Ford Prefect trying to work out which
way was up. He tested the theory that it must lie in the opposite
direction from the cold hard shore on which he was lying, and
staggered to what he hoped were his feet.
 
"I mean," he said, swaying gently, "there's no way we could have
survived that blast is there?"
 
"No," muttered Arthur. He had raised himself on to his elbows but
it didn't seem to improve things. He slumped down again.
 
"No," said Trillian, standing up, "no way at all."
 
A dull hoarse gurgling sound came from the floor. It was Zaphod
Beeblebrox attempting to speak. "I certainly didn't survive," he
gurgled, "I was a total goner. Wham bang and that was it."
 
"Yeah, thanks to you," said Ford, "We didn't stand a chance. We
must have been blown to bits. Arms, legs everywhere."
 
"Yeah," said Zaphod struggling noisily to his feet.
 
"If the lady and gentlemen would like to order drinks ..." said
the green blur, hovering impatiently beside them.
 
"Kerpow, splat," continued Zaphod, "instantaneously zonked into
our component molecules. Hey, Ford," he said, identifying one of
the slowly solidifying blurs around him, "did you get that thing
of your whole life flashing before you?"
 
"You got that too?" said Ford, "your whole life?"
 
"Yeah," said Zaphod, "at least I assume it was mine. I spent a
lot of time out of my skulls you know."
 
He looked at around him at the various shapes that were at last
becoming proper shapes instead of vague and wobbling shapeless
shapes.
 
"So ..." he said.
 
"So what?" said Ford.
 
"So here we are," said Zaphod hesitantly, "lying dead ..."
 
"Standing," Trillian corrected him.
 
"Er, standing dead," continued Zaphod, "in this desolate ..."
 
"Restaurant," said Arthur Dent who had got to his feet and could
now, much to his surprise, see clearly. That is to say, the thing
that surprised him was not that he could see, but what he could
see.
 
"Here we are," continued Zaphod doggedly, "standing dead in this
desolate ..."
 
"Five star ..." said Trillian.
 
"Restaurant," concluded Zaphod.
 
"Odd isn't it?" said Ford.
 
"Er, yeah."
 
"Nice chandeliers though," said Trillian.
 
They looked about themselves in bemusement.
 
"It's not so much an afterlife," said Arthur, "more a sort of
apres vie."
 
The chandeliers were in fact a little on the flashy side and the
low vaulted ceiling from which they hung would not, in an ideal
Universe, have been painted in that particular shade of deep
turquoise, and even if it had been it wouldn't have been
highlighted by concealed moodlighting. This is not, however, an
ideal Universe, as was further evidenced by the eye-crossing
patterns of the inlaid marble floor, and the way in which the
fronting for the eighty-yard long marble-topped bar had been
made. The fronting for the eighty-yard long marble-topped bar had
been made by stitching together nearly twenty thousand Antarean
Mosaic Lizard skins, despite the fact that the twenty thousand
lizards concerned had needed them to keep their insides in.
 
A few smartly dressed creatures were lounging casually at the bar
or relaxing in the richly coloured body-hugging seats that were
deployed here and there about the bar area. A young Vl'Hurg
officer and his green steaming young lady passed through the
large smoked glass doors at the far end of the bar into the
dazzling light of the main body of the Restaurant beyond.
 
Behind Arthur was a large curtained bay window. He pulled aside
the corner of the curtain and looked out at a landscape which
under normal circumstances would have given Arthur the creeping
horrors. These were not, however, normal circumstances, for the
thing that froze his blood and made his skin try to crawl up his
back and off the top of his head was the sky. The sky was ...
 
An attendant flunkey politely drew the curtain back into place.
 
"All in good time, sir," he said.
 
Zaphod's eyes flashed.
 
"Hey, hang about you dead guys," he said, "I think we're missing
some ultra-important thing here you know. Something somebody said
and we missed it."
 
Arthur was profoundly relieved to turn his attention from what he
had just seen.
 
He said, "I said it was a sort of apres ..."
 
"Yeah, and don't you wish you hadn't?" said Zaphod, "Ford?"
 
"I said it was odd."
 
"Yeah, shrewd but dull, perhaps it was ..."
 
"Perhaps," interrupted the green blur who had by this time
resolved into the shape of a small wizened dark-suited green
waiter, "perhaps you would care to discuss the matter over drinks
..."
 
"Drinks!" cried Zaphod, "that was it! See what you miss if you
don't stay alert."
 
"Indeed sir," said the waiter patiently. "If the lady and
gentlemen would care to order drinks before dinner ..."
 
"Dinner!" Zaphod exclaimed with passion, "Listen, little green
person, my stomach could take you home and cuddle you all night
for the mere idea."
 
"... and the Universe," concluded the waiter, determined not to
be deflected on his home stretch, "will explode later for your
pleasure."
 
Ford's head swivelled towards him. He spoke with feeling.
 
"Wow," he said, "What sort of drinks do you serve in this place?"
 
The waiter laughed a polite little waiter's laugh.
 
"Ah," he said, "I think sir has perhaps misunderstood me."
 
"Oh, I hope not," breathed Ford.
 
The waiter coughed a polite little waiter's cough.
 
"It is not unusual for our customers to be a little disoriented
by the time journey," he said, "so if I might suggest ..."
 
"Time journey?" said Zaphod.
 
"Time journey?" said Ford.
 
"Time journey?" said Trillian.
 
"You mean this isn't the afterlife?" said Arthur.
 
The waiter smiled a polite little waiter's smile. He had almost
exhausted his polite little waiter repertoire and would soon be
slipping into his role of a rather tight lipped and sarcastic
little waiter.
 
"Afterlife sir?" he said, "No sir."
 
"And we're not dead?" said Arthur.
 
The waiter tightened his lips.
 
"Aha, ha," he said, "Sir is most evidently alive, otherwise I
would not attempt to serve sir."
 
In an extraordinary gesture which is pointless attempting to
describe, Zaphod Beeblebrox slapped both his foreheads with two
of his arms and one of his thighs with the other.
 
"Hey guys," he said, "This is crazy. We finally did it. We
finally got to where we were going. This is Milliways!"
 
"Yes sir," said the waiter, laying on the patience with a trowel,
"this is Milliways - the Restaurant at the End of the Universe."
 
"End of what?" said Arthur.
 
"The Universe," repeated the waiter, very clearly and
unnecessarily distinctly.
 
"When did that end?" said Arthur.
 
"In just a few minutes, sir," said the waiter. He took a deep
breath. He didn't need to do this since his body was supplied
with the peculiar assortment of gases it required for survival
from a small intravenous device strapped to his leg. There are
times, however, when whatever your metabolism you have to take a
deep breath.
 
"Now, if you would care to order drinks at last," he said, "I
will then show you to your table."
 
Zaphod grinned two manic grins, sauntered over to the bar and
bought most of it.
 
=================================================================
Chapter 15
 
The Restaurant at the End of the Universe is one of the most
extraordinary ventures in the entire history of catering. It has
been built on the fragmented remains of ... it will be built on
the fragmented ... that is to say it will have been built by this
time, and indeed has been -
 
One of the major problems encountered in time travel is not that
of accidentally becoming your own father or mother. There is no
problem involved in becoming your own father or mother that a
broadminded and well-adjusted family can't cope with. There is
also no problem about changing the course of history - the course
of history does not change because it all fits together like a
jigsaw. All the important changes have happened before the things
they were supposed to change and it all sorts itself out in the
end.
 
The major problem is quite simply one of grammar, and the main
work to consult in this matter is Dr Dan Streetmentioner's Time
Traveller's Handbook of 1001 Tense Formations. It will tell you
for instance how to describe something that was about to happen
to you in the past before you avoided it by time-jumping forward
two days in order to avoid it. The event will be described
differently according to whether you are talking about it from
the standpoint of your own natural time, from a time in the
further future, or a time in the further past and is further
complicated by the possibility of conducting conversations whilst
you are actually travelling from one time to another with the
intention of becoming your own father or mother.
 
Most readers get as far as the Future Semi-Conditionally Modified
Subinverted Plagal Past Subjunctive Intentional before giving up:
and in fact in later editions of the book all the pages beyond
this point have been left blank to save on printing costs.
 
The Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy skips lightly over this
tangle of academic abstraction, pausing only to note that the
term "Future Perfect" has been abandoned since it was discovered
not to be.
 
To resume:
 
The Restaurant at the End of the Universe is one of the most
extraordinary ventures in the entire history of catering.
 
It is built on the fragmented remains of an eventually ruined
planet which is (wioll haven be) enclosed in a vast time bubble
and projected forward in time to the precise moment of the End of
the Universe.
 
This is, many would say, impossible.
 
In it, guests take (willan on-take) their places at table and eat
(willan on-eat) sumptuous meals whilst watching (willing watchen)
the whole of creation explode around them.
 
This is, many would say, equally impossible.
 
You can arrive (mayan arivan on-when) for any sitting you like
without prior (late fore-when) reservation because you can book
retrospectively, as it were when you return to your own time.
(you can have on-book haventa forewhen presooning returningwenta
retrohome.)
 
This is, many would now insist, absolutely impossible.
 
At the Restaurant you can meet and dine with (mayan meetan con
with dinan on when) a fascinating cross-section of the entire
population of space and time.
 
This, it can be explained patiently, is also impossible.
 
You can visit it as many times as you like (mayan on-visit re-
onvisiting ... and so on - for further tense-corrections consult
Dr Streetmentioner's book) and be sure of never meeting yourself,
because of the embarrassment this usually causes.
 
This, even if the rest were true, which it isn't, is patently
impossible, say the doubters.
 
All you have to do is deposit one penny in a savings account in
your own era, and when you arrive at the End of Time the
operation of compound interest means that the fabulous cost of
your meal has been paid for.
 
This, many claim, is not merely impossible but clearly insane,
which is why the advertising executives of the star system of
Bastablon came up with this slogan: "If you've done six
impossible things this morning, why not round it off with
breakfast at Milliways, the Restaurant at the End of the
Universe?"
 
=================================================================
Chapter 16
 
At the bar, Zaphod was rapidly becoming as tired as a newt. His
heads knocked together and his smiles were coming out of synch.
He was miserably happy.
 
"Zaphod," said Ford, "whilst you're still capable of speech,
would you care to tell me what the photon happened? Where have
you been? Where have we been? Small matter, but I'd like it
cleared up."
 
Zaphod's left head sobered up, leaving his right to sink further
into the obscurity of drink.
 
"Yeah," he said, "I've been around. They want me to find the man
who rules the Universe, but I don't care to meet him. I believe
the man can't cook."
 
His left head watched his right head saying this and then nodded.
 
"True," it said, "have another drink."
 
Ford had another Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster, the drink which has
been described as the alcoholic equivalent of a mugging -
expensive and bad for the head. Whatever had happened, Ford
decided, he didn't really care too much.
 
"Listen Ford," said Zaphod, "everything's cool and froody."
 
"You mean everything's under control."
 
"No," said Zaphod, "I do not mean everything's under control.
That would not be cool and froody. If you want to know what
happened let's just say I had the whole situation in my pocket.
OK?"
 
Ford shrugged.
 
Zaphod giggled into his drink. It frothed up over the side of the
glass and started to eat its way into the marble bar top.
 
A wild-skinned sky-gypsy approached them and played electric
violin at them until Zaphod gave him a lot of money and he agreed
to go away again.
 
The gypsy approached Arthur and Trillian sitting in another part
of the bar.
 
"I don't know what this place is," said Arthur, "but I think it
gives me the creeps."
 
"Have another drink," said Trillian, "Enjoy yourself."
 
"Which?" said Arthur, "the two are mutually exclusive."
 
"Poor Arthur, you're not really cut out for this life are you?"
 
"You call this life?"
 
"You're beginning to sound like Marvin."
 
"Marvin's the clearest thinker I know. How do you think we make
this violinist go away?"
 
The waiter approached.
 
"Your table is ready," he said.
 
Seen from the outside, which it never is, the Restaurant
resembles a giant glittering starfish beached on a forgotten
rock. Each of its arms houses the bars, the kitchens, the
forcefield generators which protect the entire structure and the
decayed planet on which it sits, and the Time Turbines which
slowly rock the whole affair backwards and forwards across the
crucial moment.
 
In the centre sits the gigantic golden dome, almost a complete
globe, and it was into this area that Zaphod, Ford, Arthur and
Trillian now passed.
 
At least five tons of glitter alone had gone into it before them,
and covered every available surface. The other surfaces were not
available because they were already encrusted with jewels,
precious sea shells from Santraginus, gold leaf, mosaic tiles,
lizard skins and a million unidentifiable embellishments and
decorations. Glass glittered, silver shone, gold gleamed, Arthur
Dent goggled.
 
"Wowee," said Zaphod, "Zappo."
 
"Incredible!" breathed Arthur, "the people ... ! The things ...
!"
 
"The things," said Ford Prefect quietly, "are also people."
 
"The people ..." resumed Arthur, "the ... other people ..."
 
"The lights ... !" said Trillian.
 
"The tables ..." said Arthur.
 
"The clothes ... !" said Trillian.
 
The waiter thought they sounded like a couple of bailiffs.
 
"The End of the Universe is very popular," said Zaphod threading
his way unsteadily through the throng of tables, some made of
marble, some of rich ultra-mahagony, some even of platinum, and
at each a party of exotic creatures chatting amongst themselves
and studying menus.
 
"People like to dress up for it," continued Zaphod, "Gives it a
sense of occasion."
 
The tables were fanned out in a large circle around a central
stage area where a small band were playing light music, at least
a thousand tables was Arthur's guess, and interspersed amongst
them were swaying palms, hissing fountains, grotesque statuary,
in short all the paraphernalia common to all Restaurants where
little expense has been spared to give the impression that no
expense has been spared. Arthur glanced around, half expecting to
see someone making an American Express commercial.
 
Zaphod lurched into Ford, who lurched back into Zaphod.
 
"Wowee," said Zaphod.
 
"Zappo," said Ford.
 
"My great granddaddy must have really screwed up the computer's
works, you know," said Zaphod, "I told it to take us to the
nearest place to eat and it sends us to the End of the Universe.
Remind me to be nice to it one day."
 
He paused.
 
"Hey, everybody's here you know. Everybody who was anybody."
 
"Was?" said Arthur.
 
"At the End of the Universe you have to use the past tense a
lot," said Zaphod, "'cos everything's been done you know. Hi,
guys," he called out to a nearby party of giant iguana lifeforms,
"How did you do?"
 
"Is that Zaphod Beeblebrox?" asked one iguana of another iguana.
 
"I think so," replied the second iguana.
 
"Well doesn't that just take the biscuit," said the first iguana.
 
"Funny old thing, life," said the second iguana.
 
"It's what you make of it," said the first and they lapsed back
into silence. They were waiting for the greatest show in the
Universe.
 
"Hey, Zaphod," said Ford, grabbing for his arm and, on account of
the third Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster, missing. He pointed a
swaying finger.
 
"There's an old mate of mine," he said, "Hotblack Desiato! See
the man at the platinum table with the platinum suit on?"
 
Zaphod tried to follow Ford's finger with his eyes but it made
him feel dizzy. Finally he saw.
 
"Oh yeah," he said, then recognition came a moment later. "Hey,"
he said, "did that guy ever make it megabig! Wow, bigger than the
biggest thing ever. Other than me."
 
"Who's he supposed to be?" asked Trillian.
 
"Hotblack Desiato?" said Zaphod in astonishment, "you don't know?
You never heard of Disaster Area?"
 
"No," said Trillian, who hadn't.
 
"The biggest," said Ford, "loudest ..."
 
"Richest ..." suggested Zaphod.
 
"... rock band in the history of ..." he searched for the word.
 
"... history itself," said Zaphod.
 
"No," said Trillian.
 
"Zowee," said Zaphod, "here we are at the End of the Universe and
you haven't even lived yet. Did you miss out."
 
He led her off to where the waiter had been waiting all this time
at the table. Arthur followed them feeling very lost and alone.
 
Ford waded off through the throng to renew an old acquaintance.
 
"Hey, er, Hotblack," he called out, "how you doing? Great to see
you big boy, how's the noise? You're looking great, really very,
very fat and unwell. Amazing." He slapped the man on the back and
was mildly surprised that it seemed to elict no response. The Pan
Galactic Gargle Blasters swirling round inside him told him to
plunge on regardless.
 
"Remember the old days?" he said, "We used to hang out, right?
The Bistro Illegal, remember? Slim's Throat Emporium? The
Evildrome Boozarama, great days eh?"
 
Hotblack Desiato offered no opinion as to whether they were great
days or not. Ford was not perturbed.
 
"And when we were hungry we'd pose as public health inspectors,
you remember that? And go around confiscating meals and drinks
right? Till we got food poisoning. Oh, and then there were the
long nights of talking and drinking in those smelly rooms above
the Cafe Lou in Gretchen Town, New Betel, and you were always in
the next room trying to write songs on your ajuitar and we all
hated them. And you said you didn't care, and we said we did
because we hated them so much." Ford's eyes were beginning to
mist over.
 
"And you said you didn't want to be a star," he continued,
wallowing in nostalgia, "because you despised the star system.
And we said, Hadra and Sulijoo and me, that we didn't think you
had the option. And what do you do now? You buy star systems!"
 
He turned and solicited the attention of those at nearby tables.
 
"Here," he said, "is a man who buys star systems!"
 
Hotblack Desiato made no attempt either to confirm or deny this
fact, and the attention of the temporary audience waned rapidly.
 
"I think someone's drunk," muttered a purple bush-like being into
his wine glass.
 
Ford staggered slightly, and sat down heavily on the chair facing
Hotblack Desiato.
 
"What's that number you do?" he said, unwisely grabbing at a
bottle for support and tipping it over - into a nearby glass as
it happened. Not to waste a happy accident, he drained the glass.
 
"That really huge number," he continued, "how does it go? `Bwarm!
Bwarm! Baderr!!' something, and in the stage act you do it ends
up with this ship crashing right into the sun, and you actually
do it!"
 
Ford crashed his fist into his other hand to illustrate this feat
graphically. He knocked the bottle over again.
 
"Ship! Sun! Wham bang!" he cried. "I mean forget lasers and
stuff, you guys are into solar flares and real sunburn! Oh, and
terrible songs."
 
His eyes followed the stream of liquid glugging out of the bottle
on to the table. Something ought to be done about it, he thought.
 
"Hey, you want a drink?" he said. It began to sink into his
squelching mind that something was missing from this reunion, and
that the missing something was in some way connected with the
fact that the fat man sitting opposite him in the platinum suit
and the silvery trilby had not yet said "Hi, Ford" or "Great to
see you after all this time," or in fact anything at all. More to
the point he had not yet even moved.
 
"Hotblack?" said Ford.
 
A large meaty hand landed on his shoulder from behind and pushed
him aside. He slid gracelessly off his seat and peered upwards to
see if he could spot the owner of this discourteous hand. The
owner was not hard to spot, on account of his being something of
the order of seven feet tall and not slightly built with it. In
fact he was built the way one builds leather sofas, shiny, lumpy
and with lots of solid stuffing. The suit into which the man's
body had been stuffed looked as if it's only purpose in life was
to demonstrate how difficult it was to get this sort of body into
a suit. The face had the texture of an orange and the colour of
an apple, but there the resemblance to anything sweet ended.
 
"Kid ..." said a voice which emerged from the man's mouth as if
it had been having a really rough time down in his chest.
 
"Er, yeah?" said Ford conversationally. He staggered back to his
feet again and was disappointed that the top of his head didn't
come further up the man's body.
 
"Beat it," said the man.
 
"Oh yeah?" said Ford, wondering how wise he was being, "and who
are you?"
 
The man considered this for a moment. He wasn't used to being
asked this sort of question. Nevertheless, after a while he came
up with an answer.
 
"I'm the guy who's telling you to beat it," he said, "before you
get it beaten for you."
 
"Now listen," said Ford nervously - he wished his head would stop
spinning, settle down and get to grips with the situation - "Now
listen," he continued, "I am one of Hotblack's oldest friends and
..."
 
He glanced at Hotblack Desiato, who still hadn't moved so much as
an eyelash.
 
"... and ..." said Ford again, wondering what would be a good
word to say after "and".
 
The large man came up with a whole sentence to go after "and". He
said it.
 
"And I am Mr Desiato's bodyguard," it went, "and I am responsible
for his body, and I am not responsible for yours, so take it away
before it gets damaged."
 
"Now wait a minute," said Ford.
 
"No minutes!" boomed the bodyguard, "no waiting! Mr Desiato
speaks to no one!"
 
"Well perhaps you'd let him say what he thinks about the matter
himself," said Ford.
 
"He speaks to no one!" bellowed the bodyguard.
 
Ford glanced anxiously at Hotblack again and was forced to admit
to himself that the bodyguard seemed to have the facts on his
side. There was still not the slightest sign of movement, let
alone keen interest in Ford's welfare.
 
"Why?" said Ford, "What's the matter with him?"
 
The bodyguard told him.
 
=================================================================
Chapter 17
 
The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy notes that Disaster Area, a
plutonium rock band from the Gagrakacka Mind Zones, are generally
held to be not only the loudest rock band in the Galaxy, but in
fact the loudest noise of any kind at all. Regular concert goers
judge that the best sound balance is usually to be heard from
within large concrete bunkers some thirty-seven miles from the
stage, whilst the musicians themselves play their instruments by
remote control from within a heavily insulated spaceship which
stays in orbit around the planet - or more frequently around a
completely different planet.
 
Their songs are on the whole very simple and mostly follow the
familiar theme of boy-being meets girl-being beneath a silvery
moon, which then explodes for no adequately explored reason.
 
Many worlds have now banned their act altogether, sometimes for
artistic reasons, but most commonly because the band's public
address system contravenes local strategic arms limitations
treaties.
 
This has not, however, stopped their earnings from pushing back
the boundaries of pure hypermathematics, and their chief research
accountant has recently been appointed Professor of
Neomathematics at the University of Maximegalon, in recognition
of both his General and his Special Theories of Disaster Area Tax
Returns, in which he proves that the whole fabric of the space-
time continuum is not merely curved, it is in fact totally bent.
 
Ford staggered back to the table where Zaphod, Arthur and
Trillian were sitting waiting for the fun to begin.
 
"Gotta have some food," said Ford.
 
"Hi, Ford," said Zaphod, "you speak to the big noise boy?"
 
Ford waggled his head noncommittally.
 
"Hotblack? I sort of spoke to him, yeah."
 
"What'd he say?"
 
"Well, not a lot really. He's ... er ..."
 
"Yeah?"
 
"He's spending a year dead for tax reasons. I've got to sit
down."
 
He sat down.
 
The waiter approached.
 
"Would you like to see the menu?" he said, "or would you like to
meet the Dish of the Day?"
 
"Huh?" said Ford.
 
"Huh?" said Arthur.
 
"Huh?" said Trillian.
 
"That's cool," said Zaphod, "we'll meet the meat."
 
In a small room in one of the arms of the Restaurant complex a
tall, thin, gangling figure pulled aside a curtain and oblivion
looked him in the face.
 
It was not a pretty face, perhaps because oblivion had looked him
in it so many times. It was too long for a start, the eyes too
sunken and too hooded, the cheeks too hollow, his lips were too
thin and too long, and when they parted his teeth looked too much
like a recently polished bay window. The hands that held the
curtain were long and thin too: they were also cold. They lay
lightly along the folds of the curtain and gave the impression
that if he didn't watch them like a hawk they would crawl away of
their own accord and do something unspeakable in a corner.
 
He let the curtain drop and the terrible light that had played on
his features went off to play somewhere more healthy. He prowled
around his small chamber like a mantis contemplating an evening's
preying, finally settling on a rickety chair by a trestle table,
where he leafed through a few sheets of jokes.
 
A bell rang.
 
He pushed the thin sheaf of papers aside and stood up. His hands
brushed limply over some of the one million rainbow-coloured
sequins with which his jacket was festooned, and he was gone
through the door.
 
In the Restaurant the lights dimmed, the band quickened its pace,
a single spotlight stabbed down into the darkness of the stairway
that led up to the centre of the stage.
 
Up the stairs bounded bounded a tall brilliantly coloured figure.
He burst on to the stage, tripped lightly up to the microphone,
removed it from its stand with one swoop of his long thin hand
and stood for a moment bowing left and right to the audience
acknowledging their applause and displaying to them his bay
window. He waved to his particular friends in the audience even
though there weren't any there, and waited for the applause to
die down.
 
He held up his hand and smiled a smile that stretched not merely
from ear to ear, but seemed to extend some way beyond the mere
confines of his face.
 
"Thank you ladies and gentlemen!" he cried, "thank you very much.
Thank you so much."
 
He eyed them with a twinkling eye.
 
"Ladies and gentlemen," he said, "The Universe as we know it has
now been in existence for over one hundred and seventy thousand
million billion years and will be ending in a little over half an
hour. So, welcome one and all to Milliways, the Restaurant at the
End of the Universe!"
 
With a gesture he deftly conjured another round of spontaneous
applause. With another gesture he cut it.
 
"I am your host for tonight," he said, "my name is Max
Quordlepleen ..." (Everybody knew this, his act was famous
throughout the known Galaxy, but he said it for the fresh
applause it generated, which he acknowledged with a disclaiming
smile and wave.) "... and I've just come straight from the very
very other end of time, where I've been hosting a show at the Big
Bang Burger Bar - where I can tell you we had a very exciting
evening ladies and gentlemen - and I will be with you right
through this historic occasion, the End of History itself!"
 
Another burst of applause died away quickly as the lights dimmed
down further. On every table candles ignited themselves
spontaneously, eliciting a slight gasp from all the diners and
wreathing them in a thousand tiny flickering lights and a million
intimate shadows. A tremor of excitement thrilled through the
darkened Restaurant as the vast golden dome above them began very
very slowly to dim, to darken, to fade.
 
Max's voice was hushed as he continued.
 
"So, ladies and gentlemen," he breathed, "the candles are lit,
the band plays softly, and as the force-shielded dome above us
fades into transparency, revealing a dark and sullen sky hung
heavy with the ancient light of livid swollen stars, I can see
we're all in for a fabulous evening's apocalypse!"
 
Even the soft tootling of the band faded away as stunned shock
descended on all those who had not seen this sight before.
 
A monstrous, grisly light poured in on them,
 
- a hideous light,
 
- a boiling, pestilential light,
 
- a light that would have disfigured hell.
 
The Universe was coming to an end.
 
For a few interminable seconds the Restaurant span silently
through the raging void. Then Max spoke again.
 
"For those of you who ever hoped to see the light at the end of
the tunnel," he said, "this is it."
 
The band struck up again.
 
"Thank you, ladies and gentlemen," cried Max, "I'll be back with
you again in just a moment, and meanwhile I leave you in the very
capable hands of Mr Reg Nullify and his cataclysmic Combo. Big
hand please ladies and gentlemen for Reg and the boys!"
 
The baleful turmoil of the skies continued.
 
Hesitantly the audience began to clap and after a moment or so
normal conversation resumed. Max began his round of the tables,
swapping jokes, shouting with laughter, earning his living.
 
A large dairy animal approached Zaphod Beeblebrox's table, a
large fat meaty quadruped of the bovine type with large watery
eyes, small horns and what might almost have been an ingratiating
smile on its lips.
 
"Good evening," it lowed and sat back heavily on its haunches, "I
am the main Dish of the Day. May I interest you in parts of my
body?" It harrumphed and gurgled a bit, wriggled its hind
quarters into a more comfortable position and gazed peacefully at
them.
 
Its gaze was met by looks of startled bewilderment from Arthur
and Trillian, a resigned shrug from Ford Prefect and naked hunger
from Zaphod Beeblebrox.
 
"Something off the shoulder perhaps?" suggested the animal,
"Braised in a white wine sauce?"
 
"Er, your shoulder?" said Arthur in a horrified whisper.
 
"But naturally my shoulder, sir," mooed the animal contentedly,
"nobody else's is mine to offer."
 
Zaphod leapt to his feet and started prodding and feeling the
animal's shoulder appreciatively.
 
"Or the rump is very good," murmured the animal. "I've been
exercising it and eating plenty of grain, so there's a lot of
good meat there." It gave a mellow grunt, gurgled again and
started to chew the cud. It swallowed the cud again.
 
"Or a casserole of me perhaps?" it added.
 
"You mean this animal actually wants us to eat it?" whispered
Trillian to Ford.
 
"Me?" said Ford, with a glazed look in his eyes, "I don't mean
anything."
 
"That's absolutely horrible," exclaimed Arthur, "the most
revolting thing I've ever heard."
 
"What's the problem Earthman?" said Zaphod, now transferring his
attention to the animal's enormous rump.
 
"I just don't want to eat an animal that's standing here inviting
me to," said Arthur, "it's heartless."
 
"Better than eating an animal that doesn't want to be eaten,"
said Zaphod.
 
"That's not the point," Arthur protested. Then he thought about
it for a moment. "Alright," he said, "maybe it is the point. I
don't care, I'm not going to think about it now. I'll just ... er
..."
 
The Universe raged about him in its death throes.
 
"I think I'll just have a green salad," he muttered.
 
"May I urge you to consider my liver?" asked the animal, "it must
be very rich and tender by now, I've been force-feeding myself
for months."
 
"A green salad," said Arthur emphatically.
 
"A green salad?" said the animal, rolling his eyes disapprovingly
at Arthur.
 
"Are you going to tell me," said Arthur, "that I shouldn't have
green salad?"
 
"Well," said the animal, "I know many vegetables that are very
clear on that point. Which is why it was eventually decided to
cut through the whole tangled problem and breed an animal that
actually wanted to be eaten and was capable of saying so clearly
and distinctly. And here I am."
 
It managed a very slight bow.
 
"Glass of water please," said Arthur.
 
"Look," said Zaphod, "we want to eat, we don't want to make a
meal of the issues. Four rare steaks please, and hurry. We
haven't eaten in five hundred and seventy-six thousand million
years."
 
The animal staggered to its feet. It gave a mellow gurgle.
 
"A very wise choice, sir, if I may say so. Very good," it said,
"I'll just nip off and shoot myself."
 
He turned and gave a friendly wink to Arthur.
 
"Don't worry, sir," he said, "I'll be very humane."
 
It waddled unhurriedly off into the kitchen.
 
A matter of minutes later the waiter arrived with four huge
steaming steaks. Zaphod and Ford wolfed straight into them
without a second's hesitation. Trillian paused, then shrugged and
started into hers.
 
Arthur stared at his feeling slightly ill.
 
"Hey, Earthman," said Zaphod with a malicious grin on the face
that wasn't stuffing itself, "what's eating you?"
 
And the band played on.
 
All around the Restaurant people and things relaxed and chatted.
The air was filled with talk of this and that, and with the
mingled scents of exotic plants, extravagant foods and insidious
wines. For an infinite number of miles in every direction the
universal cataclysm was gathering to a stupefying climax.
Glancing at his watch, Max returned to the stage with a flourish.
 
"And now, ladies and gentlemen," he beamed, "is everyone having
one last wonderful time?"
 
"Yes," called out the sort of people who call out "yes" when
comedians ask them if they're having a wonderful time.
 
"That's wonderful," enthused Max, "absolutely wonderful. And as
the photon storms gather in swirling crowds around us, preparing
to tear apart the last of the red hot suns, I know you're all
going to settle back and enjoy with me what I know we will find
all an immensely exciting and terminal experience."
 
He paused. He caught the audience with a glittering eye.
 
"Believe me, ladies and gentlemen," he said, "there's nothing
penultimate about this one."
 
He paused again. Tonight his timing was immaculate. Time after
time he had done this show, night after night. Not that the word
night had any meaning here at the extremity of time. All there
was was the endless repetition of the final moment, as the
Restaurant rocked slowly forward over the brink of time's
furthest edge - and back again. This "night" was good though, the
audience was writhing in the palm of his sickly hand. His voice
dropped. They had to strain to hear him.
 
"This," he said, "really is the absolute end, the final chilling
desolation, in which the whole majestic sweep of creation becomes
extinct. This ladies and gentlemen is the proverbial `it'."
 
He dropped his voice still lower. In the stillness, a fly would
not have dared cleat its throat.
 
"After this," he said, "there is nothing. Void. Emptiness.
Oblivion. Absolute nothing ..."
 
His eyes glittered again - or did they twinkle?"
 
"Nothing ... except of course for the sweet trolley, and a fine
selection of Aldebaran liqueurs!"
 
The band gave him a musical sting. He wished they wouldn't, he
didn't need it, not an artist of his calibre. He could play the
audience like his own musical instrument. They were laughing with
relief. He followed on.
 
"And for once," he cried cheerily, "you don't need to worry about
having a hangover in the morning - because there won't be any
more mornings!"
 
He beamed at his happy, laughing audience. He glanced up at the
sky, going through the same dead routine every night, but his
glance was only for a fraction of a second. He trusted it to do
its job, as one professional trusts another.
 
"And now," he said, strutting about the stage, "at the risk of
putting a damper on the wonderful sense of doom and futility here
this evening, I would like to welcome a few parties."
 
He pulled a card from his pocket.
 
"Do we have ..." he put up a hand to hold back the cheers, "Do we
have a party here from the Zansellquasure Flamarion Bridge Club
from beyond the Vortvoid of Qvarne? Are they here?"
 
A rousing cheer came from the back, but he pretended not to hear.
He peered around trying to find them.
 
"Are they here?" he asked again, to elict a louder cheer.
 
He got it, as he always did.
 
"Ah, there they are. Well, last bids lads - and no cheating,
remember this is a very solemn moment."
 
He lapped up the laughter.
 
"And do we also have, do we have ... a party of minor deities
from the Halls of Asgard?"
 
Away to his right came a rumble of thunder. Lightning arced
across the stage. A small group of hairy men with helmets sat
looking very pleased with themselves, and raised their glasses to
him.
 
Hasbeens, he thought to himself.
 
"Careful with that hammer, sir," he said.
 
They did their trick with the lightning again. Max gave them a
very thin lipped smile.
 
"And thirdly," he said, "thirdly a party of Young Conservatives
from Sirius B, are they here?"
 
A party of smartly dressed young dogs stopped throwing rolls at
each other and started throwing rolls at the stage. They yapped
and barked unintelligibly.
 
"Yes," said Max, "well this is all your fault, you realize that?"
 
"And finally," said Max, quieting the audience down and putting
on his solemn face, "finally I believe we have with us here
tonight, a party of believers, very devout believers, from the
Church of the Second Coming of the Great Prophet Zarquon."
 
There were about twenty of them, sitting right out on the edge of
the floor, ascetically dressed, sipping mineral water nervously,
and staying apart from the festivities. They blinked resentfully
as the spotlight was turned on them.
 
"There they are," said Max, "sitting there, patiently. He said
he'd come again, and he's kept you waiting a long time, so let's
hope he's hurrying fellas, because he's only got eight minutes
left!"
 
The party of Zarquon's followers sat rigid, refusing to be
buffeted by the waves of uncharitable laughter which swept over
them.
 
Max restrained his audience.
 
"No, but seriously though folks, seriously though, no offence
meant. No, I know we shouldn't make fun of deeply held beliefs,
so I think a big hand please for the Great Prophet Zarquon ..."
 
The audience clapped respectfully.
 
"... wherever he's got to!"
 
He blew a kiss to the stony-faced party and returned to the
centre of the stage.
 
He grabbed a tall stool and sat on it.
 
"It's marvellous though," he rattled on, "to see so many of you
here tonight - no isn't it though? Yes, absolutely marvellous.
Because I know that so many of you come here time and time again,
which I think is really wonderful, to come and watch this final
end of everything, and then return home to your own eras ... and
raise families, strive for new and better societies, fight
terrible wars for what you know to be right ... it really gives
one hope for the future of all lifekind. Except of course," he
waved at the blitzing turmoil above and around them, "that we
know it hasn't got one ..."
 
Arthur turned to Ford - he hadn't quite got this place worked out
in his mind.
 
"Look, surely," he said, "if the Universe is about to end ...
don't we go with it?"
 
Ford gave him a three-Pan-Galactic-Gargle-Blaster look, in other
words a rather unsteady one.
 
"No," he said, "look," he said, "as soon as you come into this
dive you get held in this sort of amazing force-shielded temporal
warp thing. I think."
 
"Oh," said Arthur. He turned his attention back to a bowl of soup
he'd managed to get from the waiter to replace his steak.
 
"Look," said Ford, "I'll show you."
 
He grabbed at a napkin off the table and fumbled hopelessly with
it.
 
"Look," he said again, "imagine this napkin, right, as the
temporal Universe, right? And this spoon as a transductional mode
in the matter curve ..."
 
It took him a while to say this last part, and Arthur hated to
interrupt him.
 
"That's the spoon I was eating with," he said.
 
"Alright," said Ford, "imagine this spoon ..." he found a small
wooden spoon on a tray of relishes, "this spoon ..." but found it
rather tricky to pick up, "no, better still this fork ..."
 
"Hey would you let go of my fork?" snapped Zaphod.
 
"Alright," said Ford, "alright, alright. Why don't we say ... why
don't we say that this wine glass is the temporal Universe ..."
 
"What, the one you've just knocked on the floor?"
 
"Did I do that?"
 
"Yes."
 
"Alright," said Ford, "forget that. I mean ... I mean, look, do
you know - do you know how the Universe actually began for a kick
off?"
 
"Probably not," said Arthur, who wished he'd never embarked on
any of this.
 
"Alright," said Ford, "imagine this. Right. You get this bath.
Right. A large round bath. And it's made of ebony."
 
"Where from?" said Arthur, "Harrods was destroyed by the Vogons."
 
"Doesn't matter."
 
"So you keep saying."
 
"Listen."
 
"Alright."
 
"You get this bath, see? Imagine you've got this bath. And it's
ebony. And it's conical."
 
"Conical?" said Arthur, "What sort of ..."
 
"Shhh!" said Ford. "It's conical. So what you do is, you see, you
fill it with fine white sand, alright? Or sugar. Fine white sand,
and/or sugar. Anything. Doesn't matter. Sugar's fine. And when
it's full, you pull the plug out ... are you listening?"
 
"I'm listening."
 
"You pull the plug out, and it all just twirls away, twirls away
you see, out of the plughole."
 
"I see."
 
"You don't see. You don't see at all. I haven't got to the clever
bit yet. You want to hear the clever bit?"
 
"Tell me the clever bit."
 
"I'll tell you the clever bit."
 
Ford thought for a moment, trying to remember what the clever bit
was.
 
"The clever bit," he said, "is this. You film it happening."
 
"Clever."
 
"That's not the clever bit. This is the clever bit, I remember
now that this is the clever bit. The clever bit is that you then
thread the film in the projector ... backwards!"
 
"Backwards?"
 
"Yes. Threading it backwards is definitely the clever bit. So
then, you just sit and watch it, and everything just appears to
spiral upwards out of the plughole and fill the bath. See?"
 
"And that's how the Universe began is it?" said Arthur.
 
"No," said Ford, "but it's a marvellous way to relax."
 
He reached for his wine glass.
 
"Where's my wine glass?" he said.
 
"It's on the floor."
 
"Ah."
 
Tipping back his chair to look for it, Ford collided with the
small green waiter who was approaching the table carrying a
portable telephone.
 
Ford excused himself to the waiter explaining that it was because
he was extremely drunk.
 
The waiter said that that was quite alright and that he perfectly
understood.
 
Ford thanked the waiter for his kind indulgence, attempted to tug
his forelock, missed by six inches and slid under the table.
 
"Mr Zaphod Beeblebrox?" inquired the waiter.
 
"Er, yeah?" said Zaphod, glancing up from his third steak.
 
"There is a phone call for you."
 
"Hey, what?"
 
"A phone call, sir."
 
"For me? Here? Hey, but who knows where I am?"
 
One of his minds raced. The other dawdled lovingly over the food
it was still shovelling in.
 
"Excuse me if I carry on, won't you?" said his eating head and
carried on.
 
There were now so many people after him he'd lost count. He
shouldn't have made such a conspicuous entrance. Hell, why not
though, he thought. How do you know you're having fun if there's
no one watching you have it?
 
"Maybe someone here tipped off the Galactic Police," said
Trillian. "Everyone saw you come in."
 
"You mean they want to arrest me over the phone?" said Zaphod,
"Could be. I'm a pretty dangerous dude when I'm concerned."
 
"Yeah," said a voice from under the table, "you go to pieces so
fast people get hit by the shrapnel."
 
"Hey, what is this, Judgment Day?" snapped Zaphod.
 
"Do we get to see that as well?" asked Arthur nervously.
 
"I'm in no hurry," muttered Zaphod, "OK, so who's the cat on the
phone?" He kicked Ford. "Hey get up there, kid," he said to him,
"I may need you."
 
"I am not," said the waiter, "personally acquainted with the
metal gentlemen in question, sir ..."
 
"Metal?"
 
"Yes, sir."
 
"Did you say metal?"
 
"Yes, sir. I said that I am not personally acquainted with the
metal gentleman in question ..."
 
"OK, carry on."
 
"But I am informed that he has been awaiting your return for a
considerable number of millennia. It seems you left here somewhat
precipitately."
 
"Left here?" said Zaphod, "are you being strange? We only just
arrived here."
 
"Indeed, sir," persisted the waiter doggedly, "but before you
arrived here, sir, I understand that you left here."
 
Zaphod tried this in one brain, then in the other.
 
"You're saying," he said, "that before we arrived here, we left
here?"
 
This is going to be a long night, thought the waiter.
 
"Precisely, sir," he said.
 
"Put your analyst on danger money, baby," advised Zaphod.
 
"No, wait a minute," said Ford, emerging above table level again,
"where exactly is here?"
 
"To be absolutely exact sir, it is Frogstar World B."
 
"But we just left there," protested Zaphod, "we left there and
came to the Restaurant at the End of the Universe."
 
"Yes, sir," said the waiter, feeling that he was now into the
home stretch and running well, "the one was constructed on the
ruins of the other."
 
"Oh," said Arthur brightly, "you mean we've travelled in time but
not in space."
 
"Listen you semi-evolved simian," cut in Zaphod, "go climb a tree
will you?"
 
Arthur bristled.
 
"Go bang your heads together four-eyes," he advised Zaphod.
 
"No, no," the waiter said to Zaphod, "your monkey has got it
right, sir."
 
Arthur stuttered in fury and said nothing apposite, or indeed
coherent.
 
"You jumped forward ... I believe five hundred and seventy-six
thousand million years whilst staying in exactly the same place,"
explained the waiter. He smiled. He had a wonderful feeling that
he had finally won through against what had seemed to be
insuperable odds.
 
"That's it!" said Zaphod, "I got it. I told the computer to send
us to the nearest place to eat, that's exactly what it did. Give
or take five hundred and seventy-six thousand million years, we
never moved. Neat."
 
They all agreed this was very neat.
 
"But who," said Zaphod, "is the cat on the phone?"
 
"Whatever happened to Marvin?" said Trillian.
 
Zaphod clapped his hands to his heads.
 
"The Paranoid Android! I left him moping about on Frogstar B."
 
"When was this?"
 
"Well, er, five hundred and seventy-six thousand million years
ago I suppose," said Zaphod, "Hey, er, hand me the rap-rod, Plate
Captain."
 
The little waiter's eyebrows wandered about his forehead in
confusion.
 
"I beg your pardon, sir?" he said.
 
"The phone, waiter," said Zaphod, grabbing it off him. "Shee, you
guys are so unhip it's a wonder your bums don't fall off."
 
"Indeed, sir."
 
"Hey, Marvin, is that you?" said Zaphod into the phone, "How you
doing, kid?"
 
There was a long pause before a thin low voice came up the line.
 
"I think you ought to know I'm feeling very depressed," it said.
 
Zaphod cupped his hands over the phone.
 
"It's Marvin," he said.
 
"Hey, Marvin," he said into the phone again, "we're having a
great time. Food, wine, a little personal abuse and the Universe
going foom. Where can we find you?"
 
Again the pause.
 
"You don't have to pretend to be interested in me you know," said
Marvin at last, "I know perfectly well I'm only a menial robot."
 
"OK, OK," said Zaphod, "but where are you?"
 
"`Reverse primary thrust, Marvin,' that's what they say to me,
`open airlock number three, Marvin. Marvin, can you pick up that
piece of paper?' Can I pick up that piece of paper! Here I am,
brain the size of a planet and they ask me to ..."
 
"Yeah, yeah," sympathized Zaphod hardly at all.
 
"But I'm quite used to being humiliated," droned Marvin, "I can
even go and stick my head in a bucket of water if you like. Would
you like me to go and stick my head in a bucket of water? I've
got one ready. Wait a minute."
 
"Er, hey, Marvin ..." interrupted Zaphod, but it was too late.
Sad little clunks and gurgles came up the line.
 
"What's he saying?" asked Trillian.
 
"Nothing," said Zaphod, "he just phoned up to wash his head at
us."
 
"There," said Marvin, coming back on the line and bubbling a bit,
"I hope that gave satisfaction ..."
 
"Yeah, yeah," said Zaphod, "now will you please tell us where you
are?"
 
"I'm in the car park," said Marvin.
 
"The car park?" said Zaphod, "what are you doing there?"
 
"Parking cars, what else does one do in a car park?"
 
"OK, hang in there, we'll be right down."
 
In one movement Zaphod leapt to his feet, threw down the phone
and wrote "Hotblack Desiato" on the bill.
 
"Come on guys," he said, "Marvin's in the car park. Let's get on
down."
 
"What's he doing in the car park?" asked Arthur.
 
"Parking cars, what else? Dum dum."
 
"But what about the End of the Universe? We'll miss the big
moment."
 
"I've seen it. It's rubbish," said Zaphod, "nothing but a gnab
gib."
 
"A what?"
 
"Opposite of a big bang. Come on, let's get zappy."
 
Few of the other diners paid them any attention as they weaved
their way through the Restaurant to the exit. Their eyes were
riveted on the horror of the skies.
 
"An interesting effect to watch for," Max was telling them, "is
in the upper left-hand quadrant of the sky, where if you look
very carefully you can see the star system Hastromil boiling away
into the ultra-violet. Anyone here from Hastromil?"
 
There were one or two slightly hesitant cheers from somewhere at
the back.
 
"Well," said Max beaming cheerfully at them, "it's too late to
worry about whether you left the gas on now."
 
=================================================================
Chapter 18
 
The main reception foyer was almost empty but Ford nevertheless
weaved his way through it.
 
Zaphod grasped him firmly by the arm and manoeuvred him into a
cubicle standing to one side of the entrance hall.
 
"What are you doing to him?" asked Arthur.
 
"Sobering him up," said Zaphod and pushed a coin into a slot.
Lights flashed, gases swirled.
 
"Hi," said Ford stepping out a moment later, "where are we
going?"
 
"Down to the car park, come on."
 
"What about the personnel Time Teleports?" said Ford, "Get us
straight back to the Heart of Gold."
 
"Yeah, but I've cooled on that ship. Zarniwoop can have it. I
don't want to play his games. Let's see what we can find."
 
A Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Happy Vertical People
Transporter took them down deep into the substrata beneath the
Restaurant. They were glad to see it had been vandalized and
didn't try to make them happy as well as take them down.
 
At the bottom of the shaft the lift doors opened and a blast of
cold stale air hit them.
 
The first thing they saw on leaving the lift was a long concrete
wall with over fifty doors in it offering lavatory facilities for
all of fifty major lifeforms. Nevertheless, like every car park
in the Galaxy throughout the entire history of car parks, this
car park smelt predominantly of impatience.
 
They turned a corner and found themselves on a moving catwalk
that traversed a vast cavernous space that stretched off into the
dim distance.
 
It was divided off into bays each of which contained a space ship
belonging to one of the diners upstairs, some smallish and
utilitarian mass production models, others vast shining
limoships, the playthings of the very rich.
 
Zaphod's eyes sparkled with something that may or may not have
been avarice as he passed over them. In fact it's best to be
clear on this point - avarice is definitely what it was.
 
"There he is," said Trillian, "Marvin, down there."
 
They looked where she was pointing. Dimly they could see a small
metal figure listlessly rubbing a small rag on one remote corner
of a giant silver suncruiser.
 
At short intervals along the moving catwalk, wide transparent
tubes led down to floor level. Zaphod stepped off the catwalk
into one and floated gently downwards. The others followed.
Thinking back to this later, Arthur Dent thought it was the
single most enjoyable experience of his travels in the Galaxy.
 
"Hey, Marvin," said Zaphod striding over towards to him, "Hey,
kid, are we pleased to see you."
 
Marvin turned, and in so far as it is possible for a totally
inert metal face to look reproachfully, this is what it did.
 
"No you're not," he said, "no one ever is."
 
"Suit yourself," said Zaphod and turned away to ogle the ships.
Ford went with him.
 
Only Trillian and Arthur actually went up to Marvin.
 
"No, really we are," said Trillian and patted him in a way that
he disliked intensely, "hanging around waiting for us all this
time."
 
"Five hundred and seventy-six thousand million, three thousand
five hundred and seventy-nine years," said Marvin, "I counted
them."
 
"Well, here we are now," said Trillian, felling - quite correctly
in Marvin's view - that it was a slightly foolish thing to say.
 
"The first ten million years were the worst," said Marvin, "and
the second ten million years, they were the worst too. The third
million years I didn't enjoy at all. After that I went into a bit
of decline."
 
He paused just long enough to make them feel they ought to say
something, and then interrupted.
 
"It's the people you meet in this job that really get you down,"
he said and paused again.
 
Trillian cleared her throat.
 
"Is that ..."
 
"The best conversation I had was over forty million years ago,"
continued Marvin.
 
Again the pause.
 
"Oh d ..."
 
"And that was with a coffee machine."
 
He waited.
 
"That's a ..."
 
"You don't like talking to me do you?" said Marvin in a low
desolate tone.
 
Trillian talked to Arthur instead.
 
Further down the chamber Ford Prefect had found something of
which he very much liked the look, several such things in fact.
 
"Zaphod," he said in a quiet voice, "just look at some of these
little star trolleys ..."
 
Zaphod looked and liked.
 
The craft they were looking at was in fact pretty small but
extraordinary, and very much a rich kid's toy. It was not much to
look at. It resembled nothing so much as a paper dart about
twenty feet long made of thin but tough metal foil. At the rear
end was a small horizontal two-man cockpit. It had a tiny charm-
drive engine, which was not capable of moving it at any great
speed. The thing it did have, however, was a heat-sink.
 
The heat-sink had a mass of some two thousand billion tons and
was contained within a black hole mounted in an electromagnetic
field situated half-way along the length of the ship, and this
heat-sink enabled the craft to be manoeuvred to within a few
miles of a yellow sun, there to catch and ride the solar flares
that burst out from its surface.
 
Flare-riding is one of the most exotic and exhilarating sports in
existence, and those who can dare and afford it are amongst the
most lionized men in the Galaxy. It is also of course
stupefyingly dangerous - those who don't die riding invariably
die of sexual exhaustion at one of the Daedalus Club's Apres-
Flare parties.
 
Ford and Zaphod looked and passed on.
 
"And this baby," said Ford, "the tangerine star buggy with the
black sunbusters ..."
 
Again, the star buggy was a small ship - a totally misnamed one
in fact, because the one thing it couldn't manage was
interstellar distances. Basically it was a sporty planet hopper
dolled up to something it wasn't. Nice lines though. They passed
on.
 
The next one was a big one and thirty yards long - a coach built
limoship and obviously designed with one aim in mind, that of
making the beholder sick with envy. The paintwork and accessory
detail clearly said "Not only am I rich enough to afford this
ship, I am also rich enough not to take it seriously." It was
wonderfully hideous.
 
"Just look at it," said Zaphod, "multi-cluster quark drive,
perspulex running boards. Got to be a Lazlar Lyricon custom job."
 
He examined every inch.
 
"Yes," he said, "look, the infra-pink lizard emblem on the
neutrino cowling. Lazlar's trade mark. The man has no shame."
 
"I was passed by one of these mothers once, out by the Axel
Nebula," said Ford, "I was going flat out and this thing just
strolled past me, star drive hardly ticking over. Just
incredible."
 
Zaphod whistled appreciatively.
 
"Ten seconds later", said Ford, "it smashed straight into the
third moon of Jaglan Beta."
 
"Yeah, right?"
 
"Amazing looking ship though. Looks like a fish, moves like a
fish, steers like a cow."
 
Ford looked round the other side.
 
"Hey, come and see," he called out, "there's a big mural painted
on this side. A bursting sun - Disaster Area's trade mark. This
must be Hotblack's ship. Lucky old bugger. They do this terrible
song you know which ends with a stuntship crashing into the sun.
Meant to be an amazing spectacle. Expensive in stunt ships
though."
 
Zaphod's attention however was elsewhere. His attention was
riveted on the ship standing next to Hotblack Desiato's limo. His
mouths hung open.
 
"That," he said, "that ... is really bad for the eyes ..."
 
Ford looked. He too stood astonished.
 
It was a ship of classic, simple design, like a flattened salmon,
twenty yards long, very clean, very sleek. There was just one
remarkable thing about it.
 
"It's so ... black!" said Ford Prefect, "you can hardly make out
its shape ... light just seems to fall into it!"
 
Zaphod said nothing. He had simply fallen in love.
 
The blackness of it was so extreme that it was almost impossible
to tell how close you were standing to it.
 
"Your eyes just slide off it ..." said Ford in wonder. It was an
emotional moment. He bit his lip.
 
Zaphod moved forward to it, slowly, like a man possessed - or
more accurately like a man who wanted to possess. His hand
reached out to stroke it. His hand stopped. His hand reached out
to stroke it again. His hand stopped again.
 
"Come and feel the surface," he said in a hushed voice.
 
Ford put his hand out to feel it. His hand stopped.
 
"You ... you can't ..." he said.
 
"See?" said Zaphod, "it's just totally frictionless. This must be
one mother of a mover ..."
 
He turned to look at Ford seriously. At least, one of his heads
did - the other stayed gazing in awe at the ship.
 
"What do you reckon, Ford?" he said.
 
"You mean ... er ..." Ford looked over his shoulder. "You mean
stroll off with it? You think we should?"
 
"No."
 
"Nor do I."
 
"But we're going to, aren't we?"
 
"How can we not?"
 
They gazed a little longer, till Zaphod suddenly pulled himself
together.
 
"We better shift soon," he said. "In a moment or so the Universe
will have ended and all the Captain Creeps will be pouring down
here to find their bourge-mobiles."
 
"Zaphod," said Ford.
 
"Yeah?"
 
"How do we do it?"
 
"Simple," said Zaphod. He turned. "Marvin!" he called.
 
Slowly, laboriously, and with a million little clanking and
creaking noises that he had learned to simulate, Marvin turned
round to answer the summons.
 
"Come on over here," said Zaphod, "We've got a job for you."
 
Marvin trudged towards them.
 
"I won't enjoy it," he said.
 
"Yes you will," enthused Zaphod, "there's a whole new life
stretching out ahead of you."
 
"Oh, not another one," groaned Marvin.
 
"Will you shut up and listen!" hissed Zaphod, "this time there's
going to be excitement and adventure and really wild things."
 
"Sounds awful," Marvin said.
 
"Marvin! All I'm trying to ask you ..."
 
"I suppose you want me to open this spaceship for you?"
 
"What? Er ... yes. Yeah, that's right," said Zaphod jumpily. He
was keeping at least three eyes on the entrance. Time was short.
 
"Well I wish you'd just tell me rather than try to engage my
enthusiasm," said Marvin, "because I haven't got one."
 
He walked on up to the ship, touched it, and a hatchway swung
open.
 
Ford and Zaphod stared at the opening.
 
"Don't mention it," said Marvin, "Oh, you didn't." He trudged
away again.
 
Arthur and Trillian clustered round.
 
"What's happening?" asked Arthur.
 
"Look at this," said Ford, "look at the interior of this ship."
 
"Weirder and weirder," breathed Zaphod.
 
"It's black," said Ford, "Everything in it is just totally black
..."
 
In the Restaurant, things were fast approaching the moment after
which there wouldn't be any more moments.
 
All eyes were fixed on the dome, other than those of Hotblack
Desiato's bodyguard, which were looking intently at Hotblack
Desiato, and those of Hotblack Desiato himself which the
bodyguard had closed out of respect.
 
The bodyguard leaned forward over the table. Had Hotblack Desiato
been alive, he probably would have deemed this a good moment to
lean back, or even go for a short walk. His bodyguard was not a
man which improved with proximity. On account of his unfortunate
condition, however, Hotblack Desiato remained totally inert.
 
"Mr Desiato, sir?" whispered the bodyguard. Whenever he spoke, it
looked as if the muscles on either side of his mouth were
clambering over each other to get out of the way.
 
"Mr Desiato? Can you hear me?"
 
Hotblack Desiato, quit naturally, said nothing.
 
"Hotblack?" hissed the bodyguard.
 
Again, quite naturally, Hotblack Desiato did not reply.
Supernaturally, however, he did.
 
On the table in front of him a wine glass rattled, and a fork
rose an inch or so and tapped against the glass. It settled on
the table again.
 
The bodyguard gave a satisfied grunt.
 
"It's time we get going, Mr Desiato," muttered the bodyguard,
"don't want to get caught in the rush, not in your condition. You
want to get to the next gig nice and relaxed. There was a really
big audience for it. One of the best. Kakrafoon. Five-hundred
seventy-six thousand and two million years ago. Had you will have
been looking forward to it?"
 
The fork rose again, waggled in a non-committal sort of way and
dropped again.
 
"Ah, come on," said the bodyguard, "it's going to have been
great. You knocked 'em cold." The bodyguard would have given Dr
Dan Streetmentioner an apoplectic attack.
 
"The black ship going into the sun always gets 'em, and the new
one's a beauty. Be real sorry to see it go. If we get on down
there, I'll set the black ship autopilot and we'll cruise off in
the limo. OK?"
 
The fork tapped once in agreement, and the glass of wine
mysteriously emptied itself.
 
The bodyguard wheeled Hotblack Desiato's chair out of the
Restaurant.
 
"And now," cried Max from the centre of the stage, "the moment
you've all been waiting for!" He flung his arms into the air.
Behind him, the band went into a frenzy of percussion and rolling
synthochords. Max had argued with them about this but they had
claimed it was in their contract that that's what they would do.
His agent would have to sort it out.
 
"The skies begin to boil!" he cried. "Nature collapses into the
screaming void! In twenty seconds' time, the Universe itself will
be at an end! See where the light of infinity bursts in upon us!"
 
The hideous fury of destruction blazed about them - and at that
moment a still small trumpet sounded as from an infinite
distance. Max's eyes swivelled round to glare at the band. None
of them seemed to be playing a trumpet. Suddenly a wisp of smoke
was swirling and shimmering on the stage next to him. The trumpet
was joined by more trumpets. Over five hundred times Max had done
this show, and nothing like this had ever happened before. He
drew back in alarm from the swirling smoke, and as he did so, a
figure slowly materialized inside, the figure of an ancient man,
bearded, robed and wreathed in light. In his eyes were stars and
on his brow a golden crown.
 
"What's this?" whispered Max, wild-eyed, "what's happening?"
 
At the back of the Restaurant the stony-faced party from the
Church of the Second Coming of the Great Prophet Zarquon leapt
ecstatically to their feet chanting and crying.
 
Max blinked in amazement. He threw up his arms to the audience.
 
"A big hand please, ladies and gentlemen," he hollered, "for the
Great Prophet Zarquon! He has come! Zarquon has come again!"
 
Thunderous applause broke out as Max strode across the stage and
handed his microphone to the Prophet.
 
Zarquon coughed. He peered round at the assembled gathering. The
stars in his eyes blinked uneasily. He handled the microphone
with confusion.
 
"Er ..." he said, "hello. Er, look, I'm sorry I'm a bit late.
I've had the most ghastly time, all sorts of things cropping up
at the last moment."
 
He seemed nervous of the expectant awed hush. He cleared his
throat.
 
"Er, how are we for time?" he said, "have I just got a min-"
 
And so the Universe ended.
 
=================================================================
Chapter 19
 
One of the major selling point of that wholly remarkable travel
book, the Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy, apart from its
relative cheapness and the fact that it has the words Don't Panic
written in large friendly letters on its cover, is its
compendious and occasionally accurate glossary. The statistics
relating to the geo-social nature of the Universe, for instance,
are deftly set out between pages nine hundred and thirty-eight
thousand and twenty-four and nine hundred and thirty-eight
thousand and twenty-six; and the simplistic style in which they
are written is partly explained by the fact that the editors,
having to meet a publishing deadline, copied the information off
the back of a packet of breakfast cereal, hastily embroidering it
with a few footnoted in order to avoid prosecution under the
incomprehensibly tortuous Galactic Copyright laws.
 
It is interesting to note that a later and wilier editor sent the
book backwards in time through a temporal warp, and then
successfully sued the breakfast cereal company for infringement
of the same laws.
 
Here is a sample:
 
The Universe - some information to help you live in it.
 
1~Area: Infinite.
 
The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy offers this definition of
the word "Infinite".
 
Infinite: Bigger than the biggest thing ever and then some. Much
bigger than that in fact, really amazingly immense, a totally
stunning size, "wow, that's big", time. Infinity is just so big
that by comparison, bigness itself looks really titchy. Gigantic
multiplied by colossal multiplied by staggeringly huge is the
sort of concept we're trying to get across here.
 
2~Imports: None.
 
It is impossible to import things into an infinite area, there
being no outside to import things in from.
 
3~Exports: None.
 
See imports.
 
4~Population: None.
 
It is known that there are an infinite number of worlds, simply
because there is an infinite amount of space for them to be in.
However, not every one of them is inhabited. Therefore, there
must be a finite number of inhabited worlds. Any finite number
divided by infinity is as near to nothing as makes no odds, so
the average population of all the planets in the Universe can be
said to be zero. From this it follows that the population of the
whole Universe is also zero, and that any people you may meet
from time to time are merely the products of a deranged
imagination.
 
5~Monetary Units: None.
 
In fact there are three freely convertible currencies in the
Galaxy, but none of them count. The Altairan Dollar has recently
collapsed, the Flaninian Pobble Bead is only exchangeable for
other Flaninian Pobble Beads, and the Triganic Pu has its own
very special problems. Its exchange rate of eight Ningis to one
Pu is simple enough, but since a Ningi is a triangular rubber
coin six thousand eight hundred miles across each side, no one
has ever collected enough to own one Pu. Ningis are not
negotiable currency because the Galactibanks refuse to deal in
fiddling small change. From this basic premise it is very simple
to prove that the Galactibanks are also the product of a deranged
imagination.
 
6~Art: None.
 
The function of art is to hold the mirror up to nature, and there
simply isn't a mirror big enough - see point one.
 
7~Sex: None.
 
Well, in fact there is an awful lot of this, largely because of
the total lack of money, trade, banks, art, or anything else that
might keep all the non-existent people of the Universe occupied.
 
However, it is not worth embarking on a long discussion of it now
because it really is terribly complicated. For further
information see Guide Chapters seven, nine, ten, eleven,
fourteen, sixteen, seventeen, nineteen, twenty-one to eighty-four
inclusive, and in fact most of the rest of the Guide.

Chapter 20
 
The Restaurant continued existing, but everything else had
stopped. Temporal relastatics held it and protected it in a
nothingness that wasn't merely a vacuum, it was simply nothing -
there was nothing in which a vacuum could be said to exist.
 
The force-shielded dome had once again been rendered opaque, the
party was over, the diners were leaving, Zarquon had vanished
along with the rest of the Universe, the Time Turbines were
preparing to pull the Restaurant back across the brink of time in
readiness for the lunch sitting, and Max Quordlepleen was back in
his small curtained dressing room trying to raise his agent on
the tempophone.
 
In the car park stood the black ship, closed and silent.
 
In to the car park came the late Mr Hotblack Desiato, propelled
along the moving catwalk by his bodyguard.
 
They descended one of the tubes. As they approached the limoship
a hatchway swung down from its side, engaged the wheels of the
wheelchair and drew it inside. The bodyguard followed, and having
seen his boss safely connected up to his death-support system,
moved up to the small cockpit. Here he operated the remote
control system which activated the autopilot in the black ship
lying next to the limo, thus causing great relief to Zaphod
Beeblebrox who had been trying to start the thing for over ten
minutes.
 
The black ship glided smoothly forward out of its bay, turned,
and moved down the central causeway swiftly and quietly. At the
end it accelerated rapidly, flung itself into the temporal launch
chamber and began the long journey back into the distant past.
 
The Milliways Lunch Menu quotes, by permission, a passage from
the Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy. The passage is this:
 
The History of every major Galactic Civilization tends to pass
through three distinct and recognizable phases, those of
Survival, Inquiry and Sophistication, otherwise known as the How,
Why and Where phases.
 
For instance, the first phase is characterized by the question
"How can we eat?", the second by the question "Why do we eat?"
and the third by the question, "Where shall we have lunch?"
 
The Menu goes on to suggest that Milliways, the Restaurant at the
End of the Universe, would be a very agreeable and sophisticated
answer to that third question.
 
What it doesn't go on to say is that though it will usually take
a large civilization many thousands of years to pass through the
How, Why and Where phases, small social groupings under stressful
conditions can pass through them with extreme rapidity.
 
"How are we doing?" said Arthur Dent.
 
"Badly," said Ford Prefect.
 
"Where are we going?" said Trillian.
 
"I don't know," said Zaphod Beeblebrox.
 
"Why not?" demanded Arthur Dent.
 
"Shut up," suggested Zaphod Beeblebrox and Ford Prefect.
 
"Basically, what you're trying to say," said Arthur Dent,
ignoring this suggestion, "is that we're out of control."
 
The ship was rocking and swaying sickeningly as Ford and Zaphod
tried to wrest control from the autopilot. The engined howled and
whined like tired children in a supermarket.
 
"It's the wild colour scheme that freaks me," said Zaphod whose
love affair with this ship had lasted almost three minutes into
the flight, "Every time you try to operate on of these weird
black controls that are labelled in black on a black background,
a little black light lights up black to let you know you've done
it. What is this? Some kind of galactic hyperhearse?"
 
The walls of the swaying cabin were also black, the ceiling was
black, the seats - which were rudimentary since the only
important trip this ship was designed for was supposed to be
unmanned - were black, the control panel was black, the
instruments were black, the little screws that held them in place
were black, the thin tufted nylon floor covering was black, and
when they had lifted up a corner of it they had discovered that
the foam underlay also was black.
 
"Perhaps whoever designed it had eyes that responded to different
wavelengths," offered Trillian.
 
"Or didn't have much imagination," muttered Arthur.
 
"Perhaps," said Marvin, "he was feeling very depressed."
 
In fact, though they weren't to know it, the decor had been
chosen in honour of its owner's sad, lamented, and tax-deductible
condition.
 
The ship gave a particularly sickening lurch.
 
"Take it easy," pleaded Arthur, "you're making me space sick."
 
"Time sick," said Ford, "we're plummeting backwards through
time."
 
"Thank you," said Arthur, "now I think I really am going to be
ill."
 
"Go ahead," said Zaphod, "we could do with a little colour about
this place."
 
"This is meant to be a polite after-dinner conversation is it?"
snapped Arthur.
 
Zaphod left the controls for Ford to figure out, and lurched over
to Arthur.
 
"Look, Earthman," he said angrily, "you've got a job to do,
right? The Question to the Ultimate Answer, right?"
 
"What, that thing?" said Arthur, "I thought we'd forgotten about
that."
 
"Not me, baby. Like the mice said, it's worth a lot of money in
the right quarters. And it's all locked up in that head thing of
yours."
 
"Yes but ..."
 
"But nothing! Think about it. The Meaning of Life! We get our
fingers on that we can hold every shrink in the Galaxy up to
ransom, and that's worth a bundle. I owe mine a mint."
 
Arthur took a deep breath without much enthusiasm.
 
"Alright," he said, "but where do we start? How should I know?
They say the Ultimate Answer or whatever is Forty-two, how am I
supposed to know what the question is? It could be anything. I
mean, what's six times seven?"
 
Zaphod looked at him hard for a moment. Then his eyes blazed with
excitement.
 
"Forty-two!" he cried.
 
Arthur wiped his palm across his forehead.
 
"Yes," he said patiently," I know that."
 
Zaphod's faces fell.
 
"I'm just saying that the question could be anything at all,"
said Arthur, "and I don't see how I am meant to know."
 
"Because," hissed Zaphod, "you were there when your planet did
the big firework."
 
"We have a thing on Earth ..." began Arthur.
 
"Had," corrected Zaphod.
 
"... called tact. Oh never mind. Look, I just don't know."
 
A low voice echoed dully round the cabin.
 
"I know," said Marvin.
 
Ford called out from the controls he was still fighting a losing
battle with.
 
"Stay out of this Marvin," he said, "this is organism talk."
 
"It's printed in the Earthman's brainwave patterns," continued
Marvin, "but I don't suppose you'll be very interested in knowing
that."
 
"You mean," said Arthur, "you mean you can see into my mind?"
 
"Yes," said Marvin.
 
Arthur stared in astonishment.
 
"And ...?" he said.
 
"It amazes me how you can manage to live in anything that small."
 
"Ah," said Arthur, "abuse."
 
"Yes," confirmed Marvin.
 
"Ah, ignore him," said Zaphod, "he's only making it up."
 
"Making it up?" said Marvin, swivelling his head in a parody of
astonishment, "Why should I want to make anything up? Life's bad
enough as it is without wanting to invent any more of it."
 
"Marvin," said Trillian in the gentle, kindly voice that only she
was still capable of assuming in talking to this misbegotten
creature, "if you knew all along, why then didn't you tell us?"
 
Marvin's head swivelled back to her.
 
"You didn't ask," he said simply.
 
"Well, we're asking you now, metal man," said Ford, turning round
to look at him.
 
At that moment the ship suddenly stopped rocking and swaying, the
engine pitch settled down to a gentle hum.
 
"Hey, Ford," said Zaphod, "that sounds good. Have you worked out
the controls of this boat?"
 
"No," said Ford, "I just stopped fiddling with them. I reckon we
just go to wherever this ship is going and get off it fast."
 
"Yeah, right," said Zaphod.
 
"I could tell you weren't really interested," murmured Marvin to
himself and slumped into a corner and switched himself off.
 
"Trouble is," said Ford, "that the one instrument in this while
ship that is giving any reading is worrying me. If it is what I
think it is, and if it's saying what I think it's saying, then
we've already gone too far back into the past. Maybe as much as
two million years before our own time."
 
Zaphod shrugged.
 
"Time is bunk," he said.
 
"I wonder who this ship belongs to anyway," said Arthur.
 
"Me," said Zaphod.
 
"No. Who it really belongs to."
 
"Really me," insisted Zaphod, "look, property is theft, right?
Therefore theft is property. Therefore this ship is mine, OK?"
 
"Tell the ship that," said Arthur.
 
Zaphod strode over to the console.
 
"Ship," he said, banging on the panels, "this is your new owner
speaking to ..."
 
He got no further. Several things happened at once.
 
The ship dropped out fo time travel mode and re-emerged into real
space.
 
All the controls on the console, which had been shut down for the
time trip now lit up.
 
A large vision screen above the console winked into life
revealing a wide starscape and a single very large sun dead ahead
of them.
 
None of these things, however, were responsible for the fact that
Zaphod was at the same moment hurled bodily backwards against the
rear of the cabin, as were all the others.
 
They were hurled back by a single thunderous clap of noise that
thuddered out of the monitor speakers surrounding the vision
screen.
 
=================================================================
Chapter 21
 
Down on the dry, red world of Kakrafoon, in the middle of the
vast Rudlit Desert, the stage technicians were testing the sound
system.
 
That is to say, the sound system was in the desert, not the stage
technicians. They had retreated to the safety of Disaster Area's
giant control ship which hung in orbit some four hundred miles
above the surface of the planet, and they were testing the sound
system from there. Anyone within five miles of the speaker silos
wouldn't have survived the tuning up.
 
If Arthur Dent had been within five miles of the speaker silos
then his expiring thought would have been that in both size and
shape the sound rig closely resembled Manhattan. Risen out of the
silos, the neutron phase speaker stacks towered monstrously
against the sky, obscuring the banks of plutonium reactors and
seismic amps behind them.
 
Buried deep in concrete bunkers beneath the city of speakers lay
the instruments that the musicians would control from their ship,
the massive photon-ajuitar, the bass detonator and the Megabang
drum complex.
 
It was going to be a noisy show.
 
Aboard the giant control ship, all was activity and bustle.
Hotblack Desiato's limoship, a mere tadpole beside it, had
arrived and docked, and the lamented gentleman was being
transported down the high vaulted corridors to meet the medium
who was going to interpret his psychic impulses on to the ajuitar
keyboard.
 
A doctor, a logician and a marine biologist had also just
arrived, flown in at phenomenal expense from Maximegalon to try
to reason with the lead singer who had locked himself in the
bathroom with a bottle of pills and was refusing to come out till
it could be proved conclusively to him that he wasn't a fish. The
bass player was busy machine-gunning his bedroom and the drummer
was nowhere on board.
 
Frantic inquiries led to the discovery that he was standing on a
beach on Santraginus V over a hundred light years away where, he
claimed, he had been happy over half an hour now and had found a
small stone that would be his friend.
 
The band's manager was profoundly relieved. It meant that for the
seventeenth time on this tour the drums would be played by a
robot and that therefore the timing of the cymbalistics would be
right.
 
The sub-ether was buzzing with the communications of the stage
technicians testing the speaker channels, and this it was that
was being relayed to the interior of the black ship.
 
Its dazed occupants lay against the back wall of the cabin, and
listened to the voices on the monitor speakers.
 
"OK, channel nine on power," said a voice, "testing channel
fifteen ..."
 
Another thumping crack of noise walloped through the ship.
 
"Channel fifteen AOK," said another voice.
 
A third voice cut in.
 
"The black stunt ship is now in position," it said, "it's looking
good. Gonna be a great sundive. Stage computer on line?"
 
A computer voice answered.
 
"On line," it said.
 
"Take control of the black ship."
 
"Black ship locked into trajectory programme, on standby."
 
"Testing channel twenty."
 
Zaphod leaped across the cabin and switched frequencies on the
sub-ether receiver before the next mind-pulverizing noise hit
them. He stood there quivering.
 
"What," said Trillian in a small quiet voice, "does sundive
mean?"
 
"It means," said Marvin, "that the ship os going to dive into the
sun. Sun ... Dive. It's very simple to understand. What do you
expect if you steal Hotblack Desiato's stunt ship?"
 
"How do you know ..." said Zaphod in a voice that would make a
Vegan snow lizard feel chilly, "that this is Hotblack Desiato's
stuntship?"
 
"Simple," said Marvin, "I parked it for him."
 
"The why ... didn't ... you ... tell us!"
 
"You said you wanted excitement and adventure and really wild
things."
 
"This is awful," said Arthur unnecessarily in the pause which
followed.
 
"That's what I said," confirmed Marvin.
 
On a different frequency, the sub-ether receiver had picked up a
public broadcast, which now echoed round the cabin.
 
"... fine weather for the concert here this afternoon. I'm
standing here in front of the stage," the reporter lied, "in the
middle of the Rudlit Desert, and with the aid of hyperbinoptic
glasses I can just about make out the huge audience cowering
there on the horizon all around me. Behind me the speaker stacks
rise like a sheer cliff face, and high above me the sun is
shining away and doesn't know what's going to hit it. The
environmentalist lobby do know what's going to hit it, and they
claim that the concert will cause earthquakes, tidal waves,
hurricanes, irreparable damage to the atmosphere, and all the
usual things that environmentalists usually go on about.
 
"But I've just had a report that a representative of Disaster
Area met with the environmentalists at lunchtime, and had them
all shot, so nothing now lies in the way of ..."
 
Zaphod switched it off. He turned to Ford.
 
"You know what I'm thinking?" he said.
 
"I think so," said Ford.
 
"Tell me what you think I'm thinking."
 
"I think you're thinking it's time we get off this ship."
 
"I think you're right," said Zaphod.
 
"I think you're right," said Ford.
 
"How?" said Arthur.
 
"Quiet," said Ford and Zaphod, "we're thinking."
 
"So this is it," said Arthur, "we're going to die."
 
"I wish you'd stop saying that," said Ford.
 
It is worth repeating at this point the theories that Ford had
come up with, on his first encounter with human beings, to
account for their peculiar habit of continually stating and
restating the very very obvious, as it 'It's a nice day," or
"You're very tall," or "So this is it, we're going to die."
 
His first theory was that if human beings didn't keep exercising
their lips, their mouths probably seized up.
 
After a few months of observation he had come up with a second
theory, which was this - "If human beings don't keep exercising
their lips, their brains start working."
 
In fact, this second theory is more literally true of the
Belcebron people of Kakrafoon.
 
The Belcebron people used to cause great resentment and
insecurity amongst neighboring races by being one of the most
enlightened, accomplished, and above all quiet civilizations in
the Galaxy.
 
As a punishment for this behaviour, which was held to be
offensively self righteous and provocative, a Galactic Tribunal
inflicted on them that most cruel of all social diseases,
telepathy. Consequently, in order to prevent themselves
broadcasting every slightest thought that crossed their minds to
anyone within a five mile radius, they now have to talk very
loudly and continuously about the weather, their little aches and
pains, the match this afternoon and what a noisy place Kakrafoon
had suddenly become.
 
Another method of temporarily blotting out their minds is to play
host to a Disaster Area concert.
 
The timing of the concert was critical.
 
The ship had to begin its dive before the concert began in order
to hit the sun six minutes and thirty-seven seconds before the
climax of the song to which it related, so that the light of the
solar flares had time to travel out to Kakrafoon.
 
The ship had already been diving for several minutes by the time
that Ford Prefect had completed his search of the other
compartments of the black ship. He burst back into the cabin.
 
The sun of Kakrafoon loomed terrifyingly large on the vision
screen, its blazing white inferno of fusing hydrogen nuclei
growing moment by moment as the ship plunged onwards, unheeding
the thumping and banging of Zaphod's hands on the control panel.
Arthur and Trillian had the fixed expressions of rabbits on a
night road who think that the best way of dealing with
approaching headlights is to stare them out.
 
Zaphod span round, wild-eyed.
 
"Ford," he said, "how many escape capsules are there?"
 
"None," said Ford.
 
Zaphod gibbered.
 
"Did you count them?" he yelled.
 
"Twice," said Ford, "did you manage to raise the stage crew on
the radio?"
 
"Yeah," said Zaphod, bitterly, "I said there were a whole bunch
of people on board, and they said to say `hi' to everybody."
 
Ford goggled.
 
"Didn't you tell them who we were?"
 
"Oh yeah. They said it was a great honour. That and something
about a restaurant bill and my executors."
 
Ford pushed Arthur aside and leaned forward over the control
console.
 
"Does none of this function?" he said savagely.
 
"All overridden."
 
"Smash the autopilot."
 
"Find it first. Nothing connects."
 
There was a moment's cold silence.
 
Arthur was stumbling round the back of the cabin. He stopped
suddenly.
 
"Incidentally," he said, "what does teleport mean?"
 
Another moment passed.
 
Slowly, the others turned to face him.
 
"Probably the wrong moment to ask," said Arthur, "It's just I
remember hearing you use the word a short while ago and I only
bring it up because ..."
 
"Where," said Ford Prefect quietly, "does it say teleport?"
 
"Well, just over here in fact," said Arthur, pointing at a dark
control box in the rear of the cabin, "Just under the word
`emergency', above the word `system' and beside the sign saying
`out of order'."
 
In the pandemonium that instantly followed, the only action to
follow was that of Ford Prefect lunging across the cabin to the
small black box that Arthur had indicated and stabbing repeatedly
at the single small black button set into it.
 
A six-foot square panel slid open beside it revealing a
compartment which resembled a multiple shower unit that had found
a new function in life as an electrician's junk store. Half-
finished wiring hung from the ceiling, a jumble of abandoned
components lay strewn on the floor, and the programming panel
lolled out of the cavity in the wall into which it should have
been secured.
 
A junior Disaster Area accountant, visiting the shipyard where
this ship was being constructed, had demanded to know of the
works foreman why the hell they were fitting an extremely
expensive teleport into a ship which only had one important
journey to make, and that unmanned. The foreman had explained
that the teleport was available at a ten per cent discount and
the accountant had explained that this was immaterial; the
foreman had explained that it was the finest, most powerful and
sophisticated teleport that money could buy and the accountant
had explained that the money did not wish to buy it; the foreman
had explained that people would still need to enter and leave the
ship and the accountant had explained that the ship sported a
perfectly serviceable door; the foreman had explained that the
accountant could go and boil his head and the accountant had
explained to the foreman that the thing approaching him rapidly
from his left was a knuckle sandwich. After the explanations had
been concluded, work was discontinued on the teleport which
subsequently passed unnoticed on the invoice as "Sund. explns."
at five times the price.
 
"Hell's donkeys," muttered Zaphod as he and Ford attempted to
sort through the tangle of wiring.
 
After a moment or so Ford told him to stand back. He tossed a
coin into the teleport and jiggled a switch on the lolling
control panel. With a crackle and spit of light, the coin
vanished.
 
"That much of it works," said Ford, "however, there is no
guidance system. A matter transference teleport without guidance
programming could put you ... well, anywhere."
 
The sun of Kakrafoon loomed huge on the screen.
 
"Who cares," said Zaphod, "we go where we go."
 
"And," said Ford, "there is no autosystem. We couldn't all go.
Someone would have to stay and operate it."
 
A solemn moment shuffled past. The sun loomed larger and larger.
 
"Hey, Marvin kid," said Zaphod brightly, "how you doing?"
 
"Very badly I suspect," muttered Marvin.
 
A shortish while later, the concert on Kakrafoon reached an
unexpected climax.
 
The black ship with its single morose occupant had plunged on
schedule into the nuclear furnace of the sun. Massive solar
flares licked out from it millions of miles into space, thrilling
and in a few cases spilling the dozen or so Flare Riders who had
been coasting close to the surface of the sun in anticipation of
the moment.
 
Moments before the flare light reached Kakrafoon the pounding
desert cracked along a deep faultline. A huge and hitherto
undetected underground river lying far beneath the surface gushed
to the surface to be followed seconds later by the eruption of
millions of tons of boiling lava that flowed hundreds of feet
into the air, instantaneously vaporizing the river both above and
below the surface in an explosion that echoed to the far side of
the world and back again.
 
Those - very few - who witnessed the event and survived swear
that the whole hundred thousand square miles of the desert rose
into the air like a mile-thick pancake, flipped itself over and
fell back down. At that precise moment the solar radiation from
the flares filtered through the clouds of vaporized water and
struck the ground.
 
A year later, the hundred thousand square mile desert was thick
with flowers. The structure of the atmosphere around the planet
was subtly altered. The sun blazed less harshly in the summer,
the cold bit less bitterly in the winter, pleasant rain fell more
often, and slowly the desert world of Kakrafoon became a
paradise. Even the telepathic power with which the people of
Kakrafoon had been cursed was permanently dispersed by the force
of the explosion.
 
A spokesman for Disaster Area - the one who had had all the
environmentalists shot - was later quoted as saying that it had
been "a good gig".
 
Many people spoke movingly of the healing powers of music. A few
sceptical scientists examined the records of the events more
closely, and claimed that they had discovered faint vestiges of a
vast artificially induced Improbability Field drifting in from a
nearby region of space.
 
=================================================================
Chapter 22
 
Arthur woke up and instantly regretted it. Hangovers he'd had,
but never anything on this scale. This was it, this was the big
one, this was the ultimate pits. Matter transference beams, he
decided, were not as much fun as, say, a good solid kick in the
head.
 
Being for the moment unwilling to move on account of a dull
stomping throb he was experiencing, he lay a while and thought.
The trouble with most forms of transport, he thought, is
basically one of them not being worth all the bother. On Earth -
when there had been an Earth, before it was demolished to make
way for a new hyperspace bypass - the problem had been with cars.
The disadvantages involved in pulling lots of black sticky slime
from out of the ground where it had been safely hidden out of
harm's way, turning it into tar to cover the land with, smoke to
fill the air with and pouring the rest into the sea, all seemed
to outweigh the advantages of being able to get more quickly from
one place to another - particularly when the place you arrived at
had probably become, as a result of this, very similar to the
place you had left, i.e. covered with tar, full of smoke and
short of fish.
 
And what about matter transference beams? Any form of transport
which involved tearing you apart atom by atom, flinging those
atoms through the sub-ether, and then jamming them back together
again just when they were getting their first taste of freedom
for years had to be bad news.
 
Many people had thought exactly this before Arthur Dent and had
even gone to the lengths of writing songs about it. Here is one
that used regularly to be chanted by huge crowds outside the
Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Teleport Systems factory on
Happi-Werld III:
 
Aldebaran's great, OK,
 
Algol's pretty neat,
 
Betelgeuse's pretty girls,
 
Will knock you off your feet.
 
They'll do anything you like,
 
Real fast and then real slow,
 
But if you have to take me apart to get me there,
 
Then I don't want to go.
 
Singing,
 
Take me apart, take me apart,
 
What a way to roam,
 
And if you have to take me apart to get me there,
 
I'd rather stay at home.
 
Sirius is paved with gold
 
So I've heard it said
 
By nuts who then go on to say
 
"See Tau before you're dead."
 
I'll gladly take the high road
 
Or even take the low,
 
But if you have to take me apart to get me there,
 
Then I, for one, won't go.
 
Singing,
 
Take me apart, take me apart, You must be off your head,
 
And if you try to take me apart to get me there,
 
I'll stay right here in bed.
 
 
I teleported home one night,
 
With Ron and Sid and Meg,
 
Ron stole Meggie's heart away,
 
And I got Sidney's leg.
 
Arthur felt the waves of pain slowly receding, though he was
still aware of a dull stomping throb. Slowly, carefully, he stood
up.
 
"Can you hear a dull stomping throb?" said Ford Prefect.
 
Arthur span round and wobbled uncertainly. Ford Prefect was
approaching looking red eyed and pasty.
 
"Where are we?" gasped Arthur.
 
Ford looked around. They were standing in a long curving corridor
which stretched out of sight in both directions. The outer steel
wall - which was painted in that sickly shade of pale green which
they use in schools, hospitals and mental asylums to keep the
inmates subdued - curved over the tops of their heads where it
met the inner perpendicular wall which, oddly enough was covered
in dark brown hessian wall weave. The floor was of dark green
ribbed rubber.
 
Ford moved over to a very thick dark transparent panel set in the
outer wall. It was several layers deep, yet through it he could
see pinpoints of distant stars.
 
"I think we're in a spaceship of some kind," he said.
 
Down the corridor came the sound of a dull stomping throb.
 
"Trillian?" called Arthur nervously, "Zaphod?"
 
Ford shrugged.
 
"Nowhere about," he said, "I've looked. They could be anywhere.
An unprogrammed teleport can throw you light years in any
direction. Judging by the way I feel I should think we've
travelled a very long way indeed."
 
"How do you feel?"
 
"Bad."
 
"Do you think they're ..."
 
"Where they are, how they are, there's no way we can know and no
way we can do anything about it. Do what I do."
 
"What?"
 
"Don't think about it."
 
Arthur turned this thought over in his mind, reluctantly saw the
wisdom of it, tucked it up and put it away. He took a deep
breath.
 
"Footsteps!" exclaimed Ford suddenly.
 
"Where?"
 
"That noise. That stomping throb. Pounding feet. Listen!"
 
Arthur listened. The noise echoed round the corridor at them from
an indeterminate distance. It was the muffled sound of pounding
footsteps, and it was noticeably louder.
 
"Let's move," said Ford sharply. They both moved - in opposite
directions.
 
"Not that way," said Ford, "that's where they're coming from."
 
"No it's not," said Arthur, "They're coming from that way."
 
"They're not, they're ..."
 
They both stopped. They both turned. They both listened intently.
They both agreed with each other. They both set off into opposite
directions again.
 
Fear gripped them.
 
From both directions the noise was getting louder.
 
A few yards to their left another corridor ran at right angles to
the inner wall. They ran to it and hurried along it. It was dark,
immensely long and, as they passed down it, gave them the
impression that it was getting colder and colder. Other corridors
gave off it to the left and right, each very dark and each
subjecting them to sharp blasts of icy air as they passed.
 
They stopped for a moment in alarm. The further down the corridor
they went, the louder became the sound of pounding feet.
 
They pressed themselves back against the cold wall and listened
furiously. The cold, the dark and the drumming of disembodied
feet was getting to them badly. Ford shivered, partly with the
cold, but partly with the memory of stories his favourite mother
used to tell him when he was a mere slip of a Betelgeusian, ankle
high to an Arcturan Megagrasshopper: stories of dead ships,
haunted hulks that roamed restlessly round the obscurer regions
of deep space infested with demons or the ghosts of forgotten
crews; stories too of incautious travellers who found and entered
such ships; stories of ... - then Ford remembered the brown
hessian wall weave in the first corridor and pulled himself
together. However ghosts and demons may choose to decorate their
death hulks, he thought to himself, he would lay any money you
liked it wasn't with hessian wall weave. He grasped Arthur by the
arm.
 
"Back the way we came," he said firmly and they started to
retrace their steps.
 
A moment later they leap like startled lizards down the nearest
corridor junction as the owners of the drumming feet suddenly
hove into view directly in front of them.
 
Hidden behind the corner they goggled in amazement as about two
dozen overweight men and women pounded past them in track suits
panting and wheezing in a manner that would make a heart surgeon
gibber.
 
Ford Prefect stared after them.
 
"Joggers!" he hissed, as the sound of their feet echoed away up
and down the network of corridors.
 
"Joggers?" whispered Arthur Dent.
 
"Joggers," said Ford prefect with a shrug.
 
The corridor they were concealed in was not like the others. It
was very short, and ended at a large steel door. Ford examined
it, discovered the opening mechanism and pushed it wide.
 
The first thing that hit their eyes was what appeared to be a
coffin.
 
And the next four thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine things
that hit their eyes were also coffins.
 
=================================================================
Chapter 23
 
The vault was low ceilinged, dimly lit and gigantic. At the far
end, about three hundred yards away an archway let through to
what appeared to be a similar chamber, similarly occupied.
 
Ford Prefect let out a low whistle as he stepped down on to the
floor of the vault.
 
"Wild," he said.
 
"What's so great about dead people?" asked Arthur, nervously
stepping down after him.
 
"Dunno," said Ford, "Let's find out shall we?"
 
On closer inspection the coffins seemed to be more like
sarcophagi. They stood about waist high and were constructed of
what appeared to be white marble, which is almost certainly what
it was - something that only appeared to be white marble. The
tops were semi-translucent, and through them could dimly be
perceived the features of their late and presumably lamented
occupants. They were humanoid, and had clearly left the troubles
of whatever world it was they came from far behind them, but
beyond that little else could be discerned.
 
Rolling slowly round the floor between the sarcophagi was a
heavy, oily white gas which Arthur at first thought might be
there to give the place a little atmosphere until he discovered
that it also froze his ankles. The sarcophagi too were intensely
cold to the touch.
 
Ford suddenly crouched down beside one of them. He pulled a
corner of his towel out of his satchel and started to rub
furiously at something.
 
"Look, there's a plaque on this one," he explained to Arthur,
"It's frosted over."
 
He rubbed the frost clear and examined the engraved characters.
To Arthur they looked like the footprints of a spider that had
had one too many of whatever it is that spiders have on a night
out, but Ford instantly recognized an early form of Galactic
Eezeereed.
 
"It says `Golgafrincham Ark Fleet, Ship B, Hold Seven, Telephone
Sanitizer Second Class' - and a serial number."
 
"A telephone sanitizer?" said Arthur, "a dead telephone
sanitizer?"
 
"Best kind."
 
"But what's he doing here?"
 
Ford peered through the top at the figure within.
 
"Not a lot," he said, and suddenly flashed one of those grins of
his which always made people think he'd been overdoing things
recently and should try to get some rest.
 
He scampered over to another sarcophagus. A moment's brisk towel
work and he announced:
 
"This one's a dead hairdresser. Hoopy!"
 
The next sarcophagus revealed itself to be the last resting place
of an advertising account executive; the one after that contained
a second-hand car salesman, third class.
 
An inspection hatch let into the floor suddenly caught Ford's
attention, and he squatted down to unfasten it, thrashing away at
the clouds of freezing gas that threatened to envelope him.
 
A thought occurred to Arthur.
 
"If these are just coffins," he said, "Why are they kept so
cold?"
 
"Or, indeed, why are they kept anyway," said Ford tugging the
hatchway open. The gas poured down through it. "Why in fact is
anyone going to all the trouble and expense of carting five
thousand dead bodies through space?"
 
"Ten thousand," said Arthur, pointing at the archway through
which the next chamber was dimly visible.
 
Ford stuck his head down through the floor hatchway. He looked up
again.
 
"Fifteen thousand," he said, "there's another lot down there."
 
"Fifteen million," said a voice.
 
"That's a lot," said Ford, "A lot a lot."
 
"Turn around slowly," barked the voice, "and put your hands up.
Any other move and I blast you into tiny tiny bits."
 
"Hello?" said Ford, turning round slowly, putting his hands up
and not making any other move.
 
"Why," said Arthur Dent, "isn't anyone ever pleased to see us?"
 
Standing silhouetted in the doorway through which they had
entered the vault was the man who wasn't pleased to see them. His
displeasure was communicated partly by the barking hectoring
quality of his voice and partly by the viciousness with which he
waved a long silver Kill-O-Zap gun at them. The designer of the
gun had clearly not been instructed to beat about the bush. "Make
it evil," he'd been told. "Make it totally clear that this gun
has a right end and a wrong end. Make it totally clear to anyone
standing at the wrong end that things are going badly for them.
If that means sticking all sort of spikes and prongs and
blackened bits all over it then so be it. This is not a gun for
hanging over the fireplace or sticking in the umbrella stand, it
is a gun for going out and making people miserable with."
 
Ford and Arthur looked at the gun unhappily.
 
The man with the gun moved from the door and circled round them.
As he came into the light they could see his black and gold
uniform on which the buttons were so highly polished that they
shone with an intensity that would have made an approaching
motorist flash his lights in annoyance.
 
He gestured at the door.
 
"Out," he said. People who can supply that amount of fire power
don't need to supply verbs as well. Ford and Arthur went out,
closely followed by the wrong end of the Kill-O-Zap gun and the
buttons.
 
Turning into the corridor they were jostled by twenty-four
oncoming joggers, now showered and changed, who swept on past
them into the vault. Arthur turned to watch them in confusion.
 
"Move!" screamed their captor.
 
Arthur moved.
 
Ford shrugged and moved.
 
In the vault the joggers went to twenty-four empty sarcophagi
along the side wall, opened them, climbed in, and fell into
twenty-four dreamless sleeps.
 
=================================================================
Chapter 24
 
"Er, captain ..."
 
"Yes, Number One?"
 
"Just heard a sort of report thingy from Number Two."
 
"Oh, dear."
 
High up in the bridge of the ship, the Captain stared out into
the infinite reaches of space with mild irritation. From where he
reclined beneath a wide domed bubble he could see before and
above them the vast panorama of stars through which they were
moving - a panorama that had thinned out noticably during the
course of the voyage. Turning and looking backwards, over the
vast two-mile bulk of the ship he could see the far denser mass
of stars behind them which seemed to form almost a solid band.
This was the view through the Galactic centre from which they
were travelling, and indeed had been travelling for years, at a
speed that he couldn't quite remember at the moment, but he knew
it was terribly fast. It was something approaching the speed of
something or other, or was it three times the speed of something
else? Jolly impressive anyway. He peered into the bright distance
behind the ship, looking for something. He did this every few
minutes or so, but never found what he was looking for. He didn't
let it worry him though. The scientist chaps had been very
insistent that everything was going to be perfectly alright
providing nobody panicked and everybody got on and did their bit
in an orderly fashion.
 
He wasn't panicking. As far as he was concerned everything was
going splendidly. He dabbed at his shoulder with a large frothy
sponge. It crept back into his mind that he was feeling mildly
irritated about something. Now what was all that about? A slight
cough alerted him to the fact that the ship's first officer was
still standing nearby.
 
Nice chap, Number One. Not of the very brightest, had the odd
spot of difficulty doing up his shoe laces, but jolly good
officer material for all that. The Captain wasn't a man to kick a
chap when he was bending over trying to do up his shoe laces,
however long it took him. Not like that ghastly Number Two,
strutting about all over the place, polishing his buttons,
issuing reports every hour: "Ship's still moving, Captain."
"Still on course, Captain." "Oxygen levels still being
maintained, Captain." "Give it a miss," was the Captain's vote.
Ah yes, that was the thing that had been irritating him. He
peered down at Number One.
 
"Yes, Captain, he was shouting something or other about having
found some prisoners ..."
 
The Captain thought about this. Seemed pretty unlikely to him,
but he wasn't one to stand in his officers' way.
 
"Well, perhaps that'll keep him happy for a bit," he said, "He's
always wanted some."
 
Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent trudged onwards up the ship's
apparently endless corridors. Number Two marched behind them
barking the occasional order about not making any false moves or
trying any funny stuff. They seemed to have passed at least a
mile of continuous brown hessian wall weave. Finally they reached
a large steel door which slid open when Number Two shouted at it.
 
They entered.
 
To the eyes of Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent, the most remarkable
thing about the ship's bridge was not the fifty foot diameter
hemispherical dome which covered it, and through which the
dazzling display of stars shone down on them: to people who have
eaten at the Restaurant at the End of the Universe, such wonders
are commonplace. Nor was it the bewildering array of instruments
that crowded the long circumferential wall around them. To Arthur
this was exactly what spaceships were traditionally supposed to
look like, and to Ford it looked thoroughly antiquated: it
confirmed his suspicions that Disaster Area's stuntship had taken
them back at least a million, if not two million, years before
their own time.
 
No, the thing that really caught them off balance was the bath.
 
The bath stood on a six foot pedestal of rough hewn blue water
crystal and was of a baroque monstrosity not often seen outside
the Maximegalon Museum of Diseased Imaginings. An intestinal
jumble of plumbing had been picked out in gold leaf rather than
decently buried at midnight in an unmarked grave; the taps and
shower attachment would have made a gargoyle jump.
 
As the dominant centrepiece of a starship bridge it was terribly
wrong, and it was with the embittered air of a man who knew this
that Number Two approached it.
 
"Captain, sir!" he shouted through clenched teeth - a difficult
trick but he'd had years during which to perfect it.
 
A large genial face and a genial foam covered arm popped up above
the rim of the monstrous bath.
 
"Ah, hello, Number Two," said the Captain, waving a cheery
sponge, "having a nice day?"
 
Number Two snapped even further to attention than he already was.
 
"I have brought you the prisoners I located in freezer bay seven,
sir!" he yapped.
 
Ford and Arthur coughed in confusion.
 
"Er ... hello," they said.
 
The Captain beamed at them. So Number Two had really found some
prisoners. Well, good for him, thought the Captain, nice to see a
chap doing what he's best at.
 
"Oh, hello there," he said to them, "Excuse me not getting up,
having a quick bath. Well, jynnan tonnyx all round then. Look in
the fridge Number one."
 
"Certainly sir."
 
It is a curious fact, and one to which no one knows quite how
much importance to attach, that something like 85% of all known
worlds in the Galaxy, be they primitive or highly advanced, have
invented a drink called jynnan tonnyx, or gee-N'N-T'N-ix, or
jinond-o-nicks, or any one of a thousand or more variations on
the same phonetic theme. The drinks themselves are not the same,
and vary between the Sivolvian "chinanto/mnigs" which is ordinary
water server at slightly above room temperature, and the
Gagrakackan "tzjin-anthony-ks" which kills cows at a hundred
paces; and in fact the one common factor between all of them,
beyond the fact that the names sound the same, is that they were
all invented and named before the worlds concerned made contact
with any other worlds.
 
What can be made of this fact? It exists in total isolation. As
far as any theory of structural linguistics is concerned it is
right off the graph, and yet it persists. Old structural
linguists get very angry when young structural linguists go on
about it. Young structural linguists get deeply excited about it
and stay up late at night convinced that they are very close to
something of profound importance, and end up becoming old
structural linguists before their time, getting very angry with
the young ones. Structural linguistics is a bitterly divided and
unhappy discipline, and a large number of its practitioners spend
too many nights drowning their problems in Ouisghian Zodahs.
 
Number Two stood before the Captain's bathtub trembling with
frustration.
 
"Don't you want to interrogate the prisoners sir?" he squealed.
 
The Captain peered at him in bemusement.
 
"Why on Golgafrincham should I want to do that?" he asked.
 
"To get information out of them, sir! To find out why they came
here!"
 
"Oh no, no, no," said the Captain, "I expect they just dropped in
for a quick jynnan tonnyx, don't you?"
 
"But sir, they're my prisoners! I must interrogate them!"
 
The Captain looked at them doubtfully.
 
"Oh all right," he said, "if you must. Ask them what they want to
drink."
 
A hard cold gleam came into Number Two's eyes. He advanced slowly
on Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent.
 
"All right, you scum," he growled, "you vermin ..." He jabbed
Ford with the Kill-O-Zap gun.
 
"Steady on, Number Two," admonished the Captain gently.
 
"What do you want to drink!!!" Number Two screamed.
 
"Well the jynnan tonnyx sounds very nice to me," said Ford, "What
about you Arthur?"
 
Arthur blinked.
 
"What? Oh, er, yes," he said.
 
"With ice or without?" bellowed Number Two.
 
"Oh, with please," said Ford.
 
"Lemon??!!"
 
"Yes please," said Ford, "and do you have any of those little
biscuits? You know, the cheesy ones?"
 
"I'm asking the questions!!!!" howled Number Two, his body
quaking with apoplectic fury.
 
"Er, Number Two ..." said the Captain softly.
 
"Sir?!"
 
"Push off, would you, there's a good chap. I'm trying to have a
relaxing bath."
 
Number Two's eyes narrowed and became what are known in the
Shouting and Killing People trade as cold slits, the idea
presumably being to give your opponent the impression that you
have lost your glasses or are having difficulty keeping awake.
Why this is frightening is an, as yet, unresolved problem.
 
He advanced on the captain, his (Number Two's) mouth a thin hard
line. Again, tricky to know why this is understood as fighting
behaviour. If, whilst wandering through the jungle of Traal, you
were suddenly to come upon the fabled Ravenous Bugblatter Beast,
you would have reason to be grateful if its mouth was a thin hard
line rather than, as it usually is, a gaping mass of slavering
fangs.
 
"May I remind you sir," hissed Number Two at the Captain, "that
you have now been in that bath for over three years?!" This final
shot delivered, Number Two spun on his heel and stalked off to a
corner to practise darting eye movements in the mirror.
 
The Captain squirmed in his bath. He gave Ford Prefect a lame
smile.
 
"Well you need to relax a lot in a job like mine," he said.
 
Ford slowly lowered his hands. It provoked no reaction. Arthur
lowered his.
 
Treading very slowly and carefully, Ford moved over to the bath
pedestal. He patted it.
 
"Nice," he lied.
 
He wondered if it was safe to grin. Very slowly and carefully, he
grinned. It was safe.
 
"Er ..." he said to the Captain.
 
"Yes?" said the Captain.
 
"I wonder," said Ford, "could I ask you actually what your job is
in fact?"
 
A hand tapped him on the shoulder. He span round.
 
It was the first officer.
 
"Your drinks," he said.
 
"Ah, thank you," said Ford. He and Arthur took their jynnan
tonnyx. Arthur sipped his, and was surprised to discover it
tasted very like a whisky and soda.
 
"I mean, I couldn't help noticing," said Ford, also taking a sip,
"the bodies. In the hold."
 
"Bodies?" said the Captain in surprise.
 
Ford paused and thought to himself. Never take anything for
granted, he thought. Could it be that the Captain doesn't know
he's got fifteen million dead bodies on his ship?
 
The Captain was nodding cheerfully at him. He also appeared to be
playing with a rubber duck.
 
Ford looked around. Number Two was staring at him in the mirror,
but only for an instant: his eyes were constantly on the move.
The first officer was just standing there holding the drinks tray
and smiling benignly.
 
"Bodies?" said the Captain again.
 
Ford licked his lips.
 
"Yes," he said, "All those dead telephone sanitizers and account
executives, you know, down in the hold."
 
The Captain stared at him. Suddenly he threw back his head and
laughed.
 
"Oh they're not dead," he said, "Good Lord no, no they're frozen.
They're going to be revived."
 
Ford did something he very rarely did. He blinked.
 
Arthur seemed to come out of a trance.
 
"You mean you've got a hold full of frozen hairdressers?" he
said.
 
"Oh yes," said the Captain, "Millions of them. Hairdressers,
tired TV producers, insurance salesmen, personnel officers,
security guards, public relations executives, management
consultants, you name them. We're going to colonize another
planet."
 
Ford wobbled very slightly.
 
"Exciting isn't it?" said the Captain.
 
"What, with that lot?" said Arthur.
 
"Ah, now don't misunderstand me," said the Captain, "we're just
one of the ships in the Ark Fleet. We're the `B' Ark you see.
Sorry, could I just ask you to run a bit more hot water for me?"
 
Arthur obliged, and a cascade of pink frothy water swirled around
the bath. The Captain let out a sigh of pleasure.
 
"Thank you so much my dear fellow. Do help yourselves to more
drinks of course."
 
Ford tossed down his drink, took the bottle from the first
officer's tray and refilled his glass to the top.
 
"What," he said, "is a `B' Ark?"
 
"This is," said the Captain, and swished the foamy water around
joyfully with the duck.
 
"Yes," said Ford, "but ..."
 
"Well what happened you see was," said the Captain, "our planet,
the world from which we have come, was, so to speak, doomed."
 
"Doomed?"
 
"Oh yes. So what everyone thought was, let's pack the whole
population into some giant spaceships and go and settle on
another planet."
 
Having told this much of his story, he settled back with a
satisfied grunt.
 
"You mean a less doomed one?" promoted Arthur.
 
"What did you say dear fellow?"
 
"A less doomed planet. You were going to settle on."
 
"Are going to settle on, yes. So it was decided to build three
ships, you see, three Arks in Space, and ... I'm not boring you
am I?"
 
"No, no," said Ford firmly, "it's fascinating."
 
"You know it's delightful," reflected the Captain, "to have
someone else to talk to for a change."
 
Number Two's eyes darted feverishly about the room again and then
settled back on the mirror, like a pair of flies briefly
distracted from their favourite prey of months old meat.
 
"Trouble with a long journey like this," continued the Captain,
"is that you end up just talking to yourself a lot, which gets
terribly boring because half the time you know what you're going
to say next."
 
"Only half the time?" asked Arthur in surprise.
 
The Captain thought for a moment.
 
"Yes, about half I'd say. Anyway - where's the soap?" He fished
around and found it.
 
"Yes, so anyway," he resumed, "the idea was that into the first
ship, the `A' ship, would go all the brilliant leaders, the
scientists, the great artists, you know, all the achievers; and
into the third, or `C' ship, would go all the people who did the
actual work, who made things and did things, and then into the
`B' ship - that's us - would go everyone else, the middlemen you
see."
 
He smiled happily at them.
 
"And we were sent off first," he concluded, and hummed a little
bathing tune.
 
The little bathing tune, which had been composed for him by one
of his world's most exciting and prolific jingle writer (who was
currently asleep in hold thirty-six some nine hundred yards
behind them) covered what would otherwise have been an awkward
moment of silence. Ford and Arthur shuffled their feet and
furiously avoided each other's eyes.
 
"Er ..." said Arthur after a moment, "what exactly was it that
was wrong with your planet then?"
 
"Oh, it was doomed, as I said," said the Captain, "Apparently it
was going to crash into the sun or something. Or maybe it was
that the moon was going to crash into us. Something of the kind.
Absolutely terrifying prospect whatever it was."
 
"Oh," said the first officer suddenly, "I thought it was that the
planet was going to be invaded by a gigantic swarm of twelve foot
piranha bees. Wasn't that it?"
 
Number Two span around, eyes ablaze with a cold hard light that
only comes with the amount of practise he was prepared to put in.
 
"That's not what I was told!" he hissed, "My commanding officer
told me that the entire planet was in imminent danger of being
eaten by an enormous mutant star goat!"
 
"Oh really ..." said Ford Prefect.
 
"Yes! A monstrous creature from the pit of hell with scything
teeth ten thousand miles long, breath that would boil oceans,
claws that could tear continents from their roots, a thousand
eyes that burned like the sun, slavering jaws a million miles
across, a monster such as you have never ... never ... ever ..."
 
"And they made sure they sent you lot off first did they?"
inquired Arthur.
 
"Oh yes," said the Captain, "well everyone said, very nicely I
thought, that it was very important for morale to feel that they
would be arriving on a planet where they could be sure of a good
haircut and where the phones were clean."
 
"Oh yes," agreed Ford, "I can see that would be very important.
And the other ships, er ... they followed on after you did they?"
 
For a moment the Captain did not answer. He twisted round in his
bath and gazed backwards over the huge bulk of the ship towards
the bright galactic centre. He squinted into the inconceivable
distance.
 
"Ah. Well it's funny you should say that," he said and allowed
himself a slight frown at Ford Prefect, "because curiously enough
we haven't heard a peep out of them since we left five years ago
... but they must be behind us somewhere."
 
He peered off into the distance again.
 
Ford peered with him and gave a thoughtful frown.
 
"Unless of course," he said softly, "they were eaten by the goat
..."
 
"Ah yes ..." said the Captain with a slight hesitancy creeping
into his voice, "the goat ..." His eyes passed over the solid
shapes of the instruments and computers that lined the bridge.
They winked away innocently at him. He stared out at the stars,
but none of them said a word. He glanced at his first and second
officers, but they seemed lost in their own thoughts for a
moment. He glanced at Ford Prefect who raised his eyebrows at
him.
 
"It's a funny thing you know," said the Captain at last, "but now
that I actually come to tell the story to someone else ... I mean
does it strike you as odd Number Two?"
 
"Errrrrrrrrrrr ..." said Number Two.
 
"Well," said Ford, "I can see that you've got a lot of things
you're going to talk about, so, thanks for the drinks, and if you
could sort of drop us off at the nearest convenient planet ..."
 
"Ah, well that's a little difficult you see," said the Captain,
"because our trajectory thingy was preset before we left
Golgafrincham, I think partly because I'm not very good with
figures ..."
 
"You mean we're stuck here on this ship?" exclaimed Ford suddenly
losing patience with the whole charade, "When are you meant to be
reaching this planet you're meant to be colonizing?"
 
"Oh, we're nearly there I think," said the Captain, "any second
now. It's probably time I was getting out of this bath in fact.
Oh, I don't know though, why stop just when I'm enjoying it?"
 
"So we're actually going to land in a minute?"
 
"Well not so much land, in fact, not actually land as such, no
... er ..."
 
"What are you talking about?" said Ford sharply.
 
"Well," said the Captain, picking his way through the words
carefully, "I think as far as I can remember we were programmed
to crash on it."
 
"Crash?" shouted Ford and Arthur.
 
"Er, yes," said the Captain, "yes, it's all part of the plan I
think. There was a terribly good reason for it which I can't
quite remember at the moment. It was something to with ... er
..."
 
Ford exploded.
 
"You're a load of useless bloody loonies!" he shouted.
 
"Ah yes, that was it," beamed the Captain, "that was the reason."
 
=================================================================
Chapter 25
 
The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy has this to say about the
planet of Golgafrincham: It is a planet with an ancient and
mysterious history, rich in legend, red, and occasionally green
with the blood of those who sought in times gone by to conquer
her; a land of parched and barren landscapes, of sweet and sultry
air heady with the scent of the perfumed springs that trickle
over its hot and dusty rocks and nourish the dark and musty
lichens beneath; a land of fevered brows and intoxicated
imaginings, particularly amongst those who taste the lichens; a
land also of cool and shaded thoughts amongst those who have
learnt to forswear the lichens and find a tree to sit beneath; a
land also of steel and blood and heroism; a land of the body and
of the spirit. This was its history.
 
And in all this ancient and mysterious history, the most
mysterious figures of all were without doubt those of the Great
Circling Poets of Arium. These Circling Poets used to live in
remote mountain passes where they would lie in wait for small
bands of unwary travellers, circle round them, and throw rocks at
them.
 
And when the travellers cried out, saying why didn't they go away
and get on with writing some poems instead of pestering people
with all this rock-throwing business, they would suddenly stop,
and then break into one of the seven hundred and ninety-four
great Song Cycles of Vassilian. These songs were all of
extraordinary beauty, and even more extraordinary length, and all
fell into exactly the same pattern.
 
The first part of each song would tell how there once went forth
from the City of Vassilian a party of five sage princes with four
horses. The princes, who are of course brave, noble and wise,
travel widely in distant lands, fought giant ogres, pursue exotic
philosophies, take tea with weird gods and rescue beautiful
monsters from ravening princesses before finally announcing that
they have achieved enlightenment and that their wanderings are
therefore accomplished.
 
The second, and much longer, part of each song would then tell of
all their bickerings about which one of them is going to have to
walk back.
 
All this lay in the planet's remote past. It was, however, a
descendant of one of these eccentric poets who invented the
spurious tales of impending doom which enabled the people of
Golgafrincham to rid themselves of an entire useless third of
their population. The other two-thirds stayed firmly at home and
lived full, rich and happy lives until they were all suddenly
wiped out by a virulent disease contracted from a dirty
telephone.
 
=================================================================
Chapter 26
 
That night the ship crash-landed on to an utterly insignificant
little green-blue planet which circled a small unregarded yellow
sun in the uncharted backwaters of the unfashionable end of the
Western spiral arm of the Galaxy.
 
In the hours preceding the crash Ford Prefect had fought
furiously but in vain to unlock the controls of the ship from
their pre-ordained flight path. It had quickly become apparent to
him that the ship had been programmed to convey its payload
safely, in uncomfortably, to its new home but to cripple itself
beyond repair in the process.
 
Its screaming, blazing descent through the atmosphere had
stripped away most of its superstructure and outer shielding, and
its final inglorious bellyflop into a murky swamp had left its
crew only a few hours of darkness during which to revive and
offload its deep-frozen and unwanted cargo for the ship began to
settle almost at once, slowly upending its gigantic bulk in the
stagnant slime. Once or twice during the night it was starkly
silhouetted against the sky as burning meteors - the detritus of
its descent - flashed across the sky.
 
In the grey pre-dawn light it let out an obscene roaring gurgle
and sank for ever into the stinking depths.
 
When the sun came up that morning it shed its thin watery light
over a vast area heaving with wailing hairdressers, public
relations executives, opinion pollsters and the rest, all clawing
their way desperately to dry land.
 
A less strong minded sun would probably have gone straight back
down again, but it continued to climb its way through the sky and
after a while the influence of its warming rays began to have
some restoring effect on the feebly struggling creatures.
 
Countless numbers had, unsurprisingly, been lost to the swamp in
the night, and millions more had been sucked down with the ship,
but those that survived still numbered hundreds of thousands and
as the day wore on they crawled out over the surrounding
countryside, each looking for a few square feet of solid ground
on which to collapse and recover from their nightmare ordeal.
 
Two figures moved further afield.
 
From a nearby hillside Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent watched the
horror of which they could not feel a part.
 
"Filthy dirty trick to pull," muttered Arthur.
 
Ford scraped a stick along the ground and shrugged.
 
"An imaginative solution to a problem I'd have thought," he said.
 
"Why can't people just learn to live together in peace and
harmony?" said Arthur.
 
Ford gave a loud, very hollow laugh.
 
"Forty-two!" he said with a malicious grin, "No, doesn't work.
Never mind."
 
Arthur looked at him as if he'd gone mad and, seeing nothing to
indicate the contrary, realized that it would be perfectly
reasonable to assume that this had in fact happened.
 
"What do you think will happen to them all?" he said after a
while.
 
"In an infinite Universe anything can happen," said Ford, "Even
survival. Strange but true."
 
A curious look came into his eyes as they passed over the
landscape and then settles again on the scene of misery below
them.
 
"I think they'll manage for a while," he said.
 
Arthur looked up sharply.
 
"Why do you say that?" he said.
 
Ford shrugged.
 
"Just a hunch," he said, and refused to be drawn to any further
questions.
 
"Look," he said suddenly.
 
Arthur followed his pointing finger. Down amongst the sprawling
masses a figure was moving - or perhaps lurching would be a more
accurate description. He appeared to be carrying something on his
shoulder. As he lurched from prostrate form to prostrate form he
seemed to wave whatever the something was at them in a drunken
fashion. After a while he gave up the struggle and collapsed in a
heap.
 
Arthur had no idea what this was meant to mean to him.
 
"Movie camera," said Ford. "Recording the historic movement."
 
"Well, I don't know about you," said Ford again after a moment,
"but I'm off."
 
He sat a while in silence.
 
After a while this seemed to require comment.
 
"Er, when you say you're off, what do you mean exactly?" said
Arthur.
 
"Good question," said Ford, "I'm getting total silence."
 
Looking over his shoulder Arthur saw that he was twiddling with
knobs on a small box. Ford had already introduced this box as a
Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic, but Arthur had merely nodded absently and
not pursued the matter. In his mind the Universe still divided
into two parts - the Earth, and everything else. The Earth having
been demolished to make way for a new hyperspace bypass meant
that this view of things was a little lopsided, but Arthur tended
to cling to that lopsidedness as being his last remaining contact
with his home. Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matics belonged firmly in the
"everything else" category.
 
"Not a sausage," said Ford, shaking the thing.
 
Sausage, thought Arthur to himself as he gazed listlessly at the
primitive world about him, what I wouldn't give for a good Earth
sausage.
 
"Would you believe," said Ford in exasperation, "that there are
no transmissions of any kind within light years of this benighted
tip? Are you listening to me?"
 
"What?" said Arthur.
 
"We're in trouble," said Ford.
 
"Oh," said Arthur. This sounded like month-old news to him.
 
"Until we pick up anything on this machine," said Ford, "our
chances of getting off this planet are zero. It may be some freak
standing wave effect in the planet's magnetic field - in which
case we just travel round and round till we find a clear
reception area. Coming?"
 
He picked up his gear and strode off.
 
Arthur looked down the hill. The man with the movie camera had
struggled back up to his feet just in time to film one of his
colleagues collapsing.
 
Arthur picked a blade of grass and strode off after Ford.

Chapter 27
 
"I trust you had a pleasant meal?" said Zarniwoop to Zaphod and
Trillian as they rematerialized on the bridge of the starship
Heart of Gold and lay panting on the floor.
 
Zaphod opened some eyes and glowered at him.
 
"You," he spat. He staggered to his feet and stomped off to find
a chair to slump into. He found one and slumped into it.
 
"I have programmed the computer with the Improbability
Coordinates pertinent to our journey," said Zarniwoop, "we will
arrive there very shortly. Meanwhile, why don't you relax and
prepare yourself for the meeting?"
 
Zaphod said nothing. He got up again and marched over to a small
cabinet from which he pulled a bottle of old Janx spirit. He took
a long pull at it.
 
"And when this is all done," said Zaphod savagely, "it's done,
alright? I'm free to go and do what the hell I like and lie on
beaches and stuff?"
 
"It depends what transpires from the meeting," said Zarniwoop.
 
"Zaphod, who is this man?" said Trillian shakily, wobbling to her
feet, "What's he doing here? Why's he on our ship?"
 
"He's a very stupid man," said Zaphod, "who wants to meet the man
who rules the Universe."
 
"Ah," said Trillian taking the bottle from Zaphod and helping
herself, "a social climber."
 
=================================================================
Chapter 28
 
The major problem - one of the major problems, for there are
several - one of the many major problems with governing people is
that of whom you get to do it; or rather of who manages to get
people to let them do it to them.
 
To summarize: it is a well known fact, that those people who most
want to rule people are, ipso facto, those least suited to do it.
To summarize the summary: anyone who is capable of getting
themselves made President should on no account be allowed to do
the job. To summarize the summary of the summary: people are a
problem.
 
And so this is the situation we find: a succession of Galactic
Presidents who so much enjoy the fun and palaver of being in
power that they very rarely notice that they're not.
 
And somewhere in the shadows behind them - who?
 
Who can possibly rule if no one who wants to do it can be allowed
to?
 
=================================================================
Chapter 29
 
On a small obscure world somewhere in the middle of nowhere in
particular - nowhere, that is, that could ever be found, since it
is protected by a vast field of unprobability to which only six
men in this galaxy have a key - it was raining.
 
It was bucketing down, and had been for hours. It beat the top of
the sea into a mist, it pounded the trees, it churned and slopped
a stretch of scrubby land near the sea into a mudbath.
 
The rain pelted and danced on the corrugated iron roof of the
small shack that stood in the middle of this patch of scrubby
land. It obliterated the small rough pathway that led from the
shack down to the seashore and smashed apart the neat piles of
interesting shells which had been placed there.
 
The noise of the rain on the roof of the shack was deafening
within, but went largely unnoticed by its occupant, whose
attention was otherwise engaged.
 
He was a tall shambling man with rough straw-coloured hair that
was damp from the leaking roof. His clothes were shabby, his back
was hunched, and his eyes, though open, seemed closed.
 
In his shack was an old beaten-up armchair, an old scratched
table, an old mattress, some cushions and a stove that was small
but warm.
 
There was also an old and slightly weatherbeaten cat, and this
was currently the focus of the man's attention. He bent his
shambling form over it.
 
"Pussy, pussy, pussy," he said, "coochicoochicoochicoo ... pussy
want his fish? Nice piece of fish ... pussy want it?"
 
The cat seemed undecided on the matter. It pawed rather
condescendingly at the piece of fish the man was holding out, and
then got distracted by a piece of dust on the floor.
 
"Pussy not eat his fish, pussy get thin and waste away, I think,"
said the man. Doubt crept into his voice.
 
"I imagine this is what will happen," he said, "but how can I
tell?"
 
He proffered the fish again.
 
"Pussy think," he said, "eat fish or not eat fish. I think it is
better if I don't get involved." He sighed.
 
"I think fish is nice, but then I think that rain is wet, so who
am I to judge?"
 
He left the fish on the floor for the cat, and retired to his
seat.
 
"Ah, I seem to see you eating it," he said at last, as the cat
exhausted the entertainment possibilities of the speck of dust
and pounced on to the fish.
 
"I like it when I see you eat the fish," said the man, "because
in my mind you will waste away if you don't."
 
He picked up from the table a piece of paper and the stub of a
pencil. He held one in one hand and the other in the other, and
experimented with the different ways of bringing them together.
He tried holding the pencil under the paper, then over the paper,
then next to the paper. He tried wrapping the paper round the
pencil, he tried rubbing the stubby end of the pencil against the
paper and then he tried rubbing the sharp end of the pencil
against the paper. It made a mark, and he was delighted with the
discovery, as he was every day. He picked up another piece of
paper from the table. This had a crossword on it. He studied it
briefly and filled in a couple of clues before losing interest.
 
He tried sitting on one of his hands and was intrigued by the
feel of the bones of his hip.
 
"Fish come from far away," he said, "or so I'm told. Or so I
imagine I'm told. When the men come, or when in my mind the men
come in their six black ships, do they come in your mind too?
What do you see pussy?"
 
He looked at the cat, which was more concerned with getting the
fish down as rapidly as possible than it was with these
speculations.
 
"And when I hear their questions, do you hear questions? What do
their voices mean to you? Perhaps you just think they're singing
songs to you." He reflected on this, and saw the flaw in the
supposition.
 
"Perhaps they are singing songs to you," he said, "and I just
think they're asking me questions."
 
He paused again. Sometimes he would pause for days, just to see
what it was like.
 
"Do you think they came today?" he said, "I do. There's mud on
the floor, cigarettes and whisky on the table, fish on a plate
for you and a memory of them in my mind. Hardly conclusive
evidence I know, but then all evidence is circumstantial. And
look what else they've left me."
 
He reached over to the table and pulled some things off it.
 
"Crosswords, dictionaries, and a calculator."
 
He played with the calculator for an hour, whilst the cat went to
sleep and the rain outside continued to pour. Eventually he put
the calculator aside.
 
"I think I must be right in thinking they ask me questions," he
said, "To come all that way and leave all these things for the
privilege of singing songs to you would be very strange
behaviour. Or so it seems to me. Who can tell, who can tell."
 
From the table he picked up a cigarette and lit it with a spill
from the stove. He inhaled deeply and sat back.
 
"I think I saw another ship in the sky today," he said at last.
"A big white one. I've never seen a big white one, just the six
black ones. And the six green ones. And the others who say they
come from so far away. Never a big white one. Perhaps six small
black ones can look like one big white one at certain times.
Perhaps I would like a glass of whisky. Yes, that seems more
likely."
 
He stood up and found a glass that was lying on the floor by the
mattress. He poured in a measure from his whisky bottle. He sat
again.
 
"Perhaps some other people are coming to see me," he said.
 
A hundred yards away, pelted by the torrential rain, lay the
Heart of Gold.
 
Its hatchway opened, and three figures emerged, huddling into
themselves to keep the rain off their faces.
 
"In there?" shouted Trillian above the noise of the rain.
 
"Yes," said Zarniwoop.
 
"That shack?"
 
"Yes."
 
"Weird," said Zaphod.
 
"But it's in the middle of nowhere," said Trillian, "we must have
come to the wrong place. You can't rule the Universe from a
shack."
 
They hurried through the pouring rain, and arrived, wet through,
at the door. They knocked. They shivered.
 
The door opened.
 
"Hello?" said the man.
 
"Ah, excuse me," said Zarniwoop, "I have reason to believe ..."
 
"Do you rule the Universe?" said Zaphod.
 
The man smiled at him.
 
"I try not to," he said, "Are you wet?"
 
Zaphod looked at him in astonishment.
 
"Wet?" he cried, "Doesn't it look as if we're wet?"
 
"That's how it looks to me," said the man, "but how you feel
about it might be an altogether different matter. If you feel
warmth makes you dry, you'd better come in."
 
They went in.
 
They looked around the tiny shack, Zarniwoop with slight
distaste, Trillian with interest, Zaphod with delight.
 
"Hey, er ..." said Zaphod, "what's your name?"
 
The man looked at them doubtfully.
 
"I don't know. Why, do you think I should have one? It seems very
odd to give a bundle of vague sensory perceptions a name."
 
He invited Trillian to sit in the chair. He sat on the edge of
the chair, Zarniwoop leaned stiffly against the table and Zaphod
lay on the mattress.
 
"Wowee!" said Zaphod, "the seat of power!" He tickled the cat.
 
"Listen," said Zarniwoop, "I must ask you some questions."
 
"Alright," said the man kindly, "you can sing to my cat if you
like."
 
"Would he like that?" asked Zaphod.
 
"You'd better ask him," said the man.
 
"Does he talk?" said Zaphod.
 
"I have no memory of him talking," said the man, "but I am very
unreliable."
 
Zarniwoop pulled some notes out of a pocket.
 
"Now," he said, "you do rule the Universe, do you?"
 
"How can I tell?" said the man.
 
Zarniwoop ticked off a note on the paper.
 
"How long have you been doing this?"
 
"Ah," said the man, "this is a question about the past is it?"
 
Zarniwoop looked at him in puzzlement. This wasn't exactly what
he had been expecting.
 
"Yes," he said.
 
"How can I tell," said the man, "that the past isn't a fiction
designed to account for the discrepancy between my immediate
physical sensations and my state of mind?"
 
Zarniwoop stared at him. The steam began to rise from his sodden
clothes.
 
"So you answer all questions like this?" he said.
 
The man answered quickly.
 
"I say what it occurs to me to say when I think I hear people say
things. More I cannot say."
 
Zaphod laughed happily.
 
"I'll drink to that," he said and pulled out the bottle of Janx
spirit. He leaped up and handed the bottle to the ruler of the
Universe, who took it with pleasure.
 
"Good on you, great ruler," he said, "tell it like it is."
 
"No, listen to me," said Zarniwoop, "people come to you do they?
In ships ..."
 
"I think so," said the man. He handed the bottle to Trillian.
 
"And they ask you," said Zarniwoop, "to take decisions for them?
About people's lives, about worlds, about economies, about wars,
about everything going on out there in the Universe?"
 
"Out there?" said the man, "out where?"
 
"Out there!" said Zarniwoop pointing at the door.
 
"How can you tell there's anything out there," said the man
politely, "the door's closed."
 
The rain continued to pound the roof. Inside the shack it was
warm.
 
"But you know there's a whole Universe out there!" cried
Zarniwoop. "You can't dodge your responsibilities by saying they
don't exist!"
 
The ruler of the Universe thought for a long while whilst
Zarniwoop quivered with anger.
 
"You're very sure of your facts," he said at last, "I couldn't
trust the thinking of a man who takes the Universe - if there is
one - for granted."
 
Zarniwoop still quivered, but was silent.
 
"I only decide about my Universe," continued the man quietly. "My
Universe is my eyes and my ears. Anything else is hearsay."
 
"But don't you believe in anything?"
 
The man shrugged and picked up his cat.
 
"I don't understand what you mean," he said.
 
"You don't understand that what you decide in this shack of yours
affects the lives and fates of millions of people? This is all
monstrously wrong!"
 
"I don't know. I've never met all these people you speak of. And
neither, I suspect, have you. They only exist in words we hear.
It is folly to say you know what is happening to other people.
Only they know, if they exist. They have their own Universes of
their own eyes and ears."
 
Trillian said:
 
"I think I'm just popping outside for a moment."
 
She left and walked into the rain.
 
"Do you believe other people exist?" insisted Zarniwoop.
 
"I have no opinion. How can I say?"
 
"I'd better see what's up with Trillian," said Zaphod and slipped
out.
 
Outside, he said to her:
 
"I think the Universe is in pretty good hands, yeah?"
 
"Very good," said Trillian. They walked off into the rain.
 
Inside, Zarniwoop continued.
 
"But don't you understand that people live or die on your word?"
 
The ruler of the Universe waited for as long as he could. When he
heard the faint sound of the ship's engines starting he spoke to
cover it.
 
"It's nothing to do with me," he said, "I am not involved with
people. The Lord knows I am not a cruel man."
 
"Ah!" barked Zarniwoop, "you say `The Lord'. You believe in
something!"
 
"My cat," said the man benignly, picking it up and stroking it,
"I call him The Lord. I am kind to him."
 
"Alright," said Zarniwoop, pressing home his point, "How do you
know he exists? How do you know he knows you to be kind, or
enjoys what he thinks of as your kindness?"
 
"I don't," said the man with a smile, "I have no idea. It merely
pleases me to behave in a certain way to what appears to be a
cat. Do you behave any differently? Please, I think I am tired."
 
Zarniwoop heaved a thoroughly dissatisfied sigh and looked about.
 
"Where are the other two?" he said suddenly.
 
"What other two?" said the ruler of the Universe, settling back
into his chair and refilling his whisky glass.
 
"Beeblebrox and the girl! The two who were here!"
 
"I remember no one. The past is a fiction to account for ..."
 
"Stuff it," snapped Zarniwoop and ran out into the rain. There
was no ship. The rain continued to churn the mud. There was no
sign to show where the ship had been. He hollered into the rain.
He turned and ran back to the shack and found it locked.
 
The ruler of the Universe dozed lightly in his chair. After a
while he played with the pencil and the paper again and was
delighted when he discovered how to make a mark with the one on
the other. Various noises continued outside, but he didn't know
whether they were real or not. He then talked to his table for a
week to see how it would react.
 
=================================================================
Chapter 30
 
The stars came out that night, dazzling in their brilliance and
clarity. Ford and Arthur had walked more miles than they had any
means of judging and finally stopped to rest. The night was cool
and balmy, the air pure, the Sub-Etha Sens.O.Matic totally
silent.
 
A wonderful stillness hung over the world, a magical calm which
combined with the soft fragrances of the woods, the quiet chatter
of insects and the brilliant light of the stars to soothe their
jangled spirits. Even Ford Prefect, who had seen more worlds than
he could count on a long afternoon, was moved to wonder if this
was the most beautiful he had ever seen. All that day they had
passed through rolling green hills and valleys, richly covered
with grasses, wild scented flowers and tall thickly leaved trees,
the sun had warmed them, light breezes had kept them cool, and
Ford Prefect had checked his Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic at less and
less frequent intervals, and had exhibited less and less
annoyance at its continued silence. He was beginning to think he
liked it here.
 
Cool though the night air was they slept soundly and comfortably
in the open and awoke a few hours later with the light dewfall
feeling refreshed but hungry. Ford had stuffed some small rolls
into his satchel at Milliways and they breakfasted off those
before moving on.
 
So far they had wandered purely at random, but now they struck
out firmly eastwards, feeling that if they were going to explore
this world they should have some clear idea of where they had
come from and where they were going.
 
Shortly before noon they had their first indication that the
world they had landed on was not an uninhabited one: a half
glimpsed face amongst the trees, watching them. It vanished at
the moment they both saw it, but the image they were both left
with was of a humanoid creature, curious to see them but not
alarmed. Half an hour later they glimpsed another such face, and
ten minutes after that another.
 
A minute later they stumbled into a wide clearing and stopped
short.
 
Before them in the middle of the clearing stood a group of about
two dozen men and women. They stood still and quiet facing Ford
and Arthur. Around some of the women huddled some small children
and behind the group was a ramshackle array of small dwellings
made of mud and branches.
 
Ford and Arthur held their breath.
 
The tallest of the men stood a little over five feet high, they
all stooped forward slightly, had longish arms and lowish
foreheads, and clear bright eyes with which they stared intently
at the strangers.
 
Seeing that they carried no weapons and made no move towards
them, Ford and Arthur relaxed slightly.
 
For a while the two groups simply stared at each other, neither
side making any move. The natives seemed puzzled by the
intruders, and whilst they showed no sign of aggression they were
quite clearly not issuing any invitations.
 
For a full two minutes nothing continued to happen.
 
After two minutes Ford decided it was time something happened.
 
"Hello," he said.
 
The women drew their children slightly closer to them.
 
The men made hardly any discernible move and yet their whole
disposition made it clear that the greeting was not welcome - it
was not resented in any great degree, it was just not welcome.
 
One of the men, who had been standing slightly forward of the
rest of the group and who might therefore have been their leader,
stepped forward. His face was quiet and calm, almost serene.
 
"Ugghhhuuggghhhrrrr uh uh ruh uurgh," he said quietly.
 
This caught Arthur by surprise. He had grown so used to receiving
an instantaneous and unconscious translation of everything he
heard via the Babel Fish lodged in his ear that he had ceased to
be aware of it, and he was only reminded of its presence now by
the fact that it didn't seem to be working. Vague shadows of
meaning had flickered at the back of his mind, but there was
nothing he could get any firm grasp on. He guessed, correctly as
it happens, that these people had as yet evolved no more than the
barest rudiments of language, and that the Babel Fish was
therefore powerless to help. He glanced at Ford, who was
infinitely more experienced in these matters.
 
"I think," said Ford out of the corner of his mouth, "he's asking
us if we'd mind walking on round the edge of the village."
 
A moment later, a gesture from the man-creature seemed to confirm
this.
 
"Ruurgggghhhh urrgggh; urgh urgh (uh ruh) rruurruuh ug,"
continued the man-creature.
 
"The general gist," said Ford, "as far as I can make out, is that
we are welcome to continue our journey in any way we like, but if
we would walk round his village rather than through it it would
make them all very happy."
 
"So what do we do?"
 
"I think we make them happy," said Ford.
 
Slowly and watchfully they walked round the perimeter of the
clearing. This seemed to go down very well with the natives who
bowed to them very slightly and then went about their business.
 
Ford and Arthur continued their journey through the wood. A few
hundred yards past the clearing they suddenly came upon a small
pile of fruit lying in their path - berries that looked
remarkably like raspberries and blackberries, and pulpy, green
skinned fruit that looked remarkably like pears.
 
So far they had steered clear of the fruit and berries they had
seen, though the trees and bushed were laden with them.
 
"Look at it this way," Ford Prefect had said, "fruit and berries
on strange planets either make you live or make you die.
Therefore the point at which to start toying with them is when
you're going to die if you don't. That way you stay ahead. The
secret of healthy hitch-hiking is to eat junk food."
 
They looked at the pile that lay in their path with suspicion. It
looked so good it made them almost dizzy with hunger.
 
"Look at it this way," said Ford, "er ..."
 
"Yes?" said Arthur.
 
"I'm trying to think of a way of looking at it which means we get
to eat it," said Ford.
 
The leaf-dappled sun gleamed on the pulp skins of the things
which looked like pears. The things which looked like raspberries
and strawberries were fatter and riper than any Arthur had ever
seen, even in ice cream commercials.
 
"Why don't we eat them and think about it afterwards?" he said.
 
"Maybe that's what they want us to do."
 
"Alright, look at it this way ..."
 
"Sounds good so far."
 
"It's there for us to eat. Either it's good or it's bad, either
they want to feed us or to poison us. If it's poisonous and we
don't eat it they'll just attack us some other way. If we don't
eat, we lose out either way."
 
"I like the way you're thinking," said Ford, "Now eat one."
 
Hesitantly, Arthur picked up one of those things that looked like
pears.
 
"I always thought that about the Garden of Eden story," said
Ford.
 
"Eh?"
 
"Garden of Eden. Tree. Apple. That bit, remember?"
 
"Yes of course I do."
 
"Your God person puts an apple tree in the middle of a garden and
says do what you like guys, oh, but don't eat the apple. Surprise
surprise, they eat it and he leaps out from behind a bush
shouting `Gotcha'. It wouldn't have made any difference if they
hadn't eaten it."
 
"Why not?"
 
"Because if you're dealing with somebody who has the sort of
mentality which likes leaving hats on the pavement with bricks
under them you know perfectly well they won't give up. They'll
get you in the end."
 
"What are you talking about?"
 
"Never mind, eat the fruit."
 
"You know, this place almost looks like the Garden of Eden."
 
"Eat the fruit."
 
"Sounds quite like it too."
 
Arthur took a bite from the thing which looked like a pear.
 
"It's a pear," he said.
 
A few moments later, when they had eaten the lot, Ford Prefect
turned round and called out.
 
"Thank you. Thank you very much," he called, "you're very kind."
 
They went on their way.
 
For the next fifty miles of their journey eastward they kept on
finding the occasional gift of fruit lying in their path, and
though they once or twice had a quick glimpse of a native man-
creature amongst the trees, they never again made direct contact.
They decided they rather liked a race of people who made it clear
that they were grateful simply to be left alone.
 
The fruit and berries stopped after fifty miles, because that was
where the sea started.
 
Having no pressing calls on their time they built a raft and
crossed the sea. It was reasonably calm, only about sixty miles
wide and they had a reasonably pleasant crossing, landing in a
country that was at least as beautiful as the one they had left.
 
Life was, in short, ridiculously easy and for a while at least
they were able to cope with the problems of aimlessness and
isolation by deciding to ignore them. When the craving for
company became too great they would know where to find it, but
for the moment they were happy to feel that the Golgafrinchans
were hundreds of miles behind them.
 
Nevertheless, Ford Prefect began to use his Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic
more often again. Only once did he pick up a signal, but that was
so faint and from such enormous distance that it depressed him
more than the silence that had otherwise continued unbroken.
 
On a whim they turned northwards. After weeks of travelling they
came to another sea, built another raft and crossed it. This time
it was harder going, the climate was getting colder. Arthur
suspected a streak of masochism in Ford Prefect - the increasing
difficulty of the journey seemed to give him a sense of purpose
that was otherwise lacking. He strode onwards relentlessly.
 
Their journey northwards brought them into steep mountainous
terrain of breathtaking sweep and beauty. The vast, jagged, snow
covered peaks ravished their senses. The cold began to bite into
their bones.
 
They wrapped themselves in animal skins and furs which Ford
Prefect acquired by a technique he once learned from a couple of
ex-Pralite monks running a Mind-Surfing resort in the Hills of
Hunian.
 
The galaxy is littered with ex-Pralite monks, all on the make,
because the mental control techniques the Order have evolved as a
form of devotional discipline are, frankly, sensational - and
extraordinary numbers of monks leave the Order just after they
have finished their devotional training and just before they take
their final vows to stay locked in small metal boxes for the rest
of their lives.
 
Ford's technique seemed to consist mainly of standing still for a
while and smiling.
 
After a while an animal - a deer perhaps - would appear from out
of the trees and watch him cautiously. Ford would continue to
smile at it, his eyes would soften and shine, and he would seem
to radiate a deep and universal love, a love which reached out to
embrace all of creation. A wonderful quietness would descend on
the surrounding countryside, peaceful and serene, emanating from
this transfigured man. Slowly the deer would approach, step by
step, until it was almost nuzzling him, whereupon Ford Prefect
would reach out to it and break its neck.
 
"Pheromone control," he said it was, "you just have to know how
to generate the right smell."

Chapter 31
 
A few days after landing in this mountainous land they hit a
coastline which swept diagonally before them from the south-west
to the north-east, a coastline of monumental grandeur: deep
majestic ravines, soaring pinnacles of ice - fjords.
 
For two further days they scrambled and climbed over the rocks
and glaciers, awe-struck with beauty.
 
"Arthur!" yelled Ford suddenly.
 
It was the afternoon of the second day. Arthur was sitting on a
high rock watching the thundering sea smashing itself against the
craggy promontories.
 
"Arthur!" yelled Ford again.
 
Arthur looked to where Ford's voice had come from, carried
faintly in the wind.
 
Ford had gone to examine a glacier, and Arthur found him there
crouching by the solid wall of blue ice. He was tense with
excitement - his eyes darted up to meet Arthur's.
 
"Look," he said, "look!"
 
Arthur looked. He saw the solid wall of blue ice.
 
"Yes," he said, "it's a glacier. I've already seen it."
 
"No," said Ford, "you've looked at it, you haven't seen it.
Look!"
 
Ford was pointing deep into the heart of the ice.
 
Arthur peered - he saw nothing but vague shadows.
 
"Move back from it," insisted Ford, "look again."
 
Arthur moved back and looked again.
 
"No," he said, and shrugged. "What am I supposed to be looking
for?"
 
And suddenly he saw it.
 
"You see it?"
 
He saw it.
 
His mouth started to speak, but his brain decided it hadn't got
anything to say yet and shut it again. His brain then started to
contend with the problem of what his eyes told it they were
looking at, but in doing so relinquished control of the mouth
which promptly fell open again. Once more gathering up the jaw,
his brain lost control of his left hand which then wandered
around in an aimless fashion. For a second or so the brain tried
to catch the left hand without letting go of the mouth and
simultaneously tried to think about what was buried in the ice,
which is probably why the legs went and Arthur dropped restfully
to the ground.
 
The thing that had been causing all this neural upset was a
network of shadows in the ice, about eighteen inches beneath the
surface. Looked at it from the right angle they resolved into the
solid shapes of letters from an alien alphabet, each about three
feet high; and for those, like Arthur, who couldn't read
Magrathean there was above the letters the outline of a face
hanging in the ice.
 
It was an old face, thin and distinguished, careworn but not
unkind.
 
It was the face of the man who had won an award for designing the
coastline they now knew themselves to be standing on.
 
=================================================================
Chapter 32
 
A thin whine filled the air. It whirled and howled through the
trees upsetting the squirrels. A few birds flew off in disgust.
The noise danced and skittered round the clearing. It whooped, it
rasped, it generally offended.
 
The Captain, however, regarded the lone bagpiper with an
indulgent eye. Little could disturb his equanimity; indeed, once
he had got over the loss of his gorgeous bath during that
unpleasantness in the swamp all those months ago he had begun to
find his new life remarkably congenial. A hollow had been scooped
out of a large rock which stood in the middle of the clearing,
and in this he would bask daily whilst attendants sloshed water
over him. Not particularly warm water, it must be said, as they
hadn't yet worked out a way of heating it. Never mind, that would
come, and in the meantime search parties were scouring the
countryside far and wide for a hot spring, preferably one in a
nice leafy glade, and if it was near a soap mine - perfection. To
those who said that they had a feeling soap wasn't found in
mines, the Captain had ventured to suggest that perhaps that was
because no one had looked hard enough, and this possibility had
been reluctantly acknowledged.
 
No, life was very pleasant, and the greatest thing about it was
that when the hot spring was found, complete with leafy glade en
suite, and when in the fullness of time the cry came
reverberating across the hills that the soap mine had been
located and was producing five hundred cakes a day it would be
more pleasant still. It was very important to have things to look
forward to.
 
Wail, wail, screech, wail, howl, honk, squeak went the bagpipes,
increasing the Captain's already considerable pleasure at the
thought that any moment now they might stop. That was something
he looked forward to as well.
 
What else was pleasant, he asked himself? Well, so many things:
the red and gold of the trees, now that autumn was approaching;
the peaceful chatter of scissors a few feet from his bath where a
couple of hairdressers were exercising their skills on a dozing
art director and his assistant; the sunlight gleaming off the six
shiny telephones lined up along the edge of his rock-hewn bath.
The only thing nicer than a phone that didn't ring all the time
(or indeed at all) was six phones that didn't ring all the time
(or indeed at all).
 
Nicest of all was the happy murmur of all the hundreds of people
slowly assembling in the clearing around him to watch the
afternoon committee meeting.
 
The Captain punched his rubber duck playfully on the beak. The
afternoon committee meetings were his favourite.
 
Other eyes watched the assembling crowds. High in a tree on the
edge of the clearing squatted Ford Prefect, lately returned from
foreign climes. After his six month journey he was lean and
healthy, his eyes gleamed, he wore a reindeer-skin coat; his
beard was as thick and his face as bronzed as a country-rock
singer's.
 
He and Arthur Dent had been watching the Golgafrinchans for
almost a week now, and Ford had decided to stir things up a bit.
 
The clearing was now full. Hundreds of men and women lounged
around, chatting, eating fruit, playing cards and generally
having a fairly relaxed time of it. Their track suits were now
all dirty and even torn, but they all had immaculately styled
hair. Ford was puzzled to see that many of them had stuffed their
track suits full of leaves and wondered if this was meant to be
some form of insulation against the coming winter. Ford's eyes
narrowed. They couldn't be interested in botany of a sudden could
they?
 
In the middle of these speculations the Captain's voice rose
above the hubbub.
 
"Alright," he said, "I'd like to call this meeting to some sort
of order if that's at all possible. Is that alright with
everybody?" He smiled genially. "In a minute. When you're all
ready."
 
The talking gradually died away and the clearing fell silent,
except for the bagpiper who seemed to be in some wild and
uninhabitable musical world of his own. A few of those in his
immediate vicinity threw some leaves to him. If there was any
reason for this then it escaped Ford Prefect for the moment.
 
A small group of people had clustered round the Captain and one
of them was clearly beginning to speak. He did this by standing
up, clearing his throat and then gazing off into the distance as
if to signify to the crowd that he would be with them in a
minute.
 
The crowd of course were riveted and all turned their eyes on
him.
 
A moment of silence followed, which Ford judged to be the right
dramatic moment to make his entry. The man turned to speak.
 
Ford dropped down out of the tree.
 
"Hi there," he said.
 
The crowd swivelled round.
 
"Ah my dear fellow," called out the Captain, "Got any matches on
you? Or a lighter? Anything like that?"
 
"No," said Ford, sounding a little deflated. It wasn't what he'd
prepared. He decided he'd better be a little stronger on the
subject.
 
"No I haven't," he continued, "No matches. Instead I bring you
news ..."
 
"Pity," said the Captain, "We've all run out you see. Haven't had
a hot bath in weeks."
 
Ford refused to be headed off.
 
"I bring you news," he said, "of a discovery that might interest
you."
 
"Is it on the agenda?" snapped the man whom Ford had interrupted.
 
Ford smiled a broad country-rock singer smile.
 
"Now, come on," he said.
 
"Well I'm sorry," said the man huffily, "but speaking as a
management consultant of many years' standing, I must insist on
the importance of observing the committee structure."
 
Ford looked round the crowd.
 
"He's mad you know," he said, "this is a prehistoric planet."
 
"Address the chair!" snapped the management consultant.
 
"There isn't chair," explained Ford, "there's only a rock."
 
The management consultant decided that testiness was what the
situation now called for.
 
"Well, call it a chair," he said testily.
 
"Why not call it a rock?" asked Ford.
 
"You obviously have no conception," said the management
consultant, not abandoning testiness in favour of good old
fashioned hauteur, "of modern business methods."
 
"And you have no conception of where you are," said Ford.
 
A girl with a strident voice leapt to her feet and used it.
 
"Shut up, you two," she said, "I want to table a motion."
 
"You mean boulder a motion," tittered a hairdresser.
 
"Order, order!" yapped the management consultant.
 
"Alright," said Ford, "let's see how you are doing." He plonked
himself down on the ground to see how long he could keep his
temper.
 
The Captain made a sort of conciliatory harrumphing noise.
 
"I would like to call to order," he said pleasantly, "the five
hundred and seventy-third meeting of the colonization committee
of Fintlewoodlewix ..."
 
Ten seconds, thought Ford as he leapt to his feet again.
 
"This is futile," he exclaimed, "five hundred and seventy-three
committee meetings and you haven't even discovered fire yet!"
 
"If you would care," said the girl with the strident voice, "to
examine the agenda sheet ..."
 
"Agenda rock," trilled the hairdresser happily.
 
"Thank you, I've made that point," muttered Ford.
 
"... you ... will ... see ..." continued the girl firmly, "that
we are having a report from the hairdressers' Fire Development
Sub-Committee today."
 
"Oh ... ah -" said the hairdresser with a sheepish look which is
recognized the whole Galaxy over as meaning "Er, will next
Tuesday do?"
 
"Alright," said Ford, rounding on him, "what have you done? What
are you going to do? What are your thoughts on fire development?"
 
"Well I don't know," said the hairdresser, "All they gave me was
a couple of sticks ..."
 
"So what have you done with them?"
 
Nervously, the hairdresser fished in his track suit top and
handed over the fruits of his labour to Ford.
 
Ford held them up for all to see.
 
"Curling tongs," he said.
 
The crowd applauded.
 
"Never mind," said Ford, "Rome wasn't burnt in a day."
 
The crowd hadn't the faintest idea what he was talking about, but
they loved it nevertheless. They applauded.
 
"Well, you're obviously being totally naive of course," said the
girl, "When you've been in marketing as long as I have you'll
know that before any new product can be developed it has to be
properly researched. We've got to find out what people want from
fire, how they relate to it, what sort of image it has for them."
 
The crowd were tense. They were expecting something wonderful
from Ford.
 
"Stick it up your nose," he said.
 
"Which is precisely the sort of thing we need to know," insisted
the girl, "Do people want fire that can be applied nasally?"
 
"Do you?" Ford asked the crowd.
 
"Yes!" shouted some.
 
"No!" shouted others happily.
 
They didn't know, they just thought it was great.
 
"And the wheel," said the Captain, "What about this wheel thingy?
It sounds a terribly interesting project."
 
"Ah," said the marketing girl, "Well, we're having a little
difficulty there."
 
"Difficulty?" exclaimed Ford, "Difficulty? What do you mean,
difficulty? It's the single simplest machine in the entire
Universe!"
 
The marketing girl soured him with a look.
 
"Alright, Mr Wiseguy," she said, "you're so clever, you tell us
what colour it should have."
 
The crowd went wild. One up to the home team, they thought. Ford
shrugged his shoulders and sat down again.
 
"Almighty Zarquon," he said, "have none of you done anything?"
 
As if in answer to his question there was a sudden clamour of
noise from the entrance to the clearing. The crowd couldn't
believe the amount of entertainment they were getting this
afternoon: in marched a squad of about a dozen men dressed in the
remnants of their Golgafrincham 3rd Regiment dress uniforms.
About half of them still carried Kill-O-Zap guns, the rest now
carried spears which they struck together as they marched. They
looked bronzed, healthy, and utterly exhausted and bedraggled.
They clattered to a halt and banged to attention. One of them
fell over and never moved again.
 
"Captain, sir!" cried Number Two - for he was their leader -
"Permission to report sir!"
 
"Yes, alright Number Two, welcome back and all that. Find any hot
springs?" said the Captain despondently.
 
"No sir!"
 
"Thought you wouldn't."
 
Number Two strode through the crowd and presented arms before the
bath.
 
"We have discovered another continent!"
 
"When was this?"
 
"It lies across the sea ..." said Number Two, narrowing his eyes
significantly, "to the east!"
 
"Ah."
 
Number Two turned to face the crowd. He raised his gun above his
head. This is going to be great, thought the crowd.
 
"We have declared war on it!"
 
Wild abandoned cheering broke out in all corners of the clearing
- this was beyond all expectation.
 
"Wait a minute," shouted Ford Prefect, "wait a minute!"
 
He leapt to his feet and demanded silence. After a while he got
it, or at least the best silence he could hope for under the
circumstances: the circumstances were that the bagpiper was
spontaneously composing a national anthem.
 
"Do we have to have the piper?" demanded Ford.
 
"Oh yes," said the Captain, "we've given him a grant."
 
Ford considered opening this idea up for debate but quickly
decided that that way madness lay. Instead he slung a well judged
rock at the piper and turned to face Number Two.
 
"War?" he said.
 
"Yes!" Number Two gazed contemptuously at Ford Prefect.
 
"On the next continent?"
 
"Yes! Total warfare! The war to end all wars!"
 
"But there's no one even living there yet!"
 
Ah, interesting, thought the crowd, nice point.
 
Number Two's gaze hovered undisturbed. In this respect his eyes
were like a couple of mosquitos that hover purposefully three
inches from your nose and refuse to be deflected by arm thrashes,
fly swats or rolled newspapers.
 
"I know that," he said, "but there will be one day! So we have
left an open-ended ultimatum."
 
"What?"
 
"And blown up a few military installations."
 
The Captain leaned forward out of his bath.
 
"Military installations Number Two?" he said.
 
For a moment the eyes wavered.
 
"Yes sir, well potential military installations. Alright ...
trees."
 
The moment of uncertainty passed - his eyes flickered like whips
over his audience.
 
"And," he roared, "we interrogated a gazelle!"
 
He flipped his Kill-O-Zap gun smartly under his arm and marched
off through the pandemonium that had now erupted throughout the
ecstatic crowd. A few steps was all he managed before he was
caught up and carried shoulder high for a lap of honour round the
clearing.
 
Ford sat and idly tapped a couple of stones together.
 
"So what else have you done?" he inquired after the celebrations
had died down.
 
"We have started a culture," said the marketing girl.
 
"Oh yes?" said Ford.
 
"Yes. One of our film producers is already making a fascinating
documentary about the indigenous cavemen of the area."
 
"They're not cavemen."
 
"They look like cavemen."
 
"Do they live in caves?"
 
"Well ..."
 
"They live in huts."
 
"Perhaps they're having their caves redecorated," called out a
wag from the crowd.
 
Ford rounded on him angrily.
 
"Very funny," he said, "but have you noticed that they're dying
out?"
 
On their journey back, Ford and Arthur had come across two
derelict villages and the bodies of many natives in the woods,
where they had crept away to die. Those that still lived were
stricken and listless, as if they were suffering some disease of
the spirit rather than the body. They moved sluggishly and with
an infinite sadness. Their future had been taken away from them.
 
"Dying out!" repeated Ford. "Do you know what that means?"
 
"Er ... we shouldn't sell them any life insurance?" called out
the wag again.
 
Ford ignored him, and appealed to the whole crowd.
 
"Can you try and understand," he said, "that it's just since
we've arrived that they've started dying out!"
 
"In fact that comes over terribly well in this film," said the
marketing girl, "and just gives it that poignant twist which is
the hallmark of the really great documentary. The producer's very
committed."
 
"He should be," muttered Ford.
 
"I gather," said the girl, turning to address the Captain who was
beginning to nod off, "that he wants to make one about you next,
Captain."
 
"Oh really?" he said, coming to with a start, "that's awfully
nice."
 
"He's got a very strong angle on it, you know, the burden of
responsibility, the loneliness of command ..."
 
The Captain hummed and hahed about this for a moment.
 
"Well, I wouldn't overstress that angle, you know," he said
finally, "one's never alone with a rubber duck."
 
He held the duck aloft and it got an appreciative round from the
crowd.
 
All the while, the Management Consultant had been sitting in
stony silence, his finger tips pressed to his temples to indicate
that he was waiting and would wait all day if it was necessary.
 
At this point he decided he would not wait all day after all, he
would merely pretend that the last half hour hadn't happened.
 
He rose to his feet.
 
"If," he said tersely, "we could for a moment move on to the
subject of fiscal policy ..."
 
"Fiscal policy!" whooped Ford Prefect, "Fiscal policy!"
 
The Management Consultant gave him a look that only a lungfish
could have copied.
 
"Fiscal policy ..." he repeated, "that is what I said."
 
"How can you have money," demanded Ford, "if none of you actually
produces anything? It doesn't grow on trees you know."
 
"If you would allow me to continue ..."
 
Ford nodded dejectedly.
 
"Thank you. Since we decided a few weeks ago to adopt the leaf as
legal tender, we have, of course, all become immensely rich."
 
Ford stared in disbelief at the crowd who were murmuring
appreciatively at this and greedily fingering the wads of leaves
with which their track suits were stuffed.
 
"But we have also," continued the Management Consultant, "run
into a small inflation problem on account of the high level of
leaf availability, which means that, I gather, the current going
rate has something like three deciduous forests buying one ship's
peanut."
 
Murmurs of alarm came from the crowd. The Management Consultant
waved them down.
 
"So in order to obviate this problem," he continued, "and
effectively revaluate the leaf, we are about to embark on a
massive defoliation campaign, and ... er, burn down all the
forests. I think you'll all agree that's a sensible move under
the circumstances."
 
The crowd seemed a little uncertain about this for a second or
two until someone pointed out how much this would increase the
value of the leaves in their pockets whereupon they let out
whoops of delight and gave the Management Consultant a standing
ovation. The accountants amongst them looked forward to a
profitable Autumn.
 
"You're all mad," explained Ford Prefect.
 
"You're absolutely barmy," he suggested.
 
"You're a bunch of raving nutters," he opined.
 
The tide of opinion started to turn against him. What had started
out as excellent entertainment had now, in the crowd's view,
deteriorated into mere abuse, and since this abuse was in the
main directed at them they wearied of it.
 
Sensing this shift in the wind, the marketing girl turned on him.
 
"Is it perhaps in order," she demanded, "to inquire what you've
been doing all these months then? You and that other interloper
have been missing since the day we arrived."
 
"We've been on a journey," said Ford, "We went to try and find
out something about this planet."
 
"Oh," said the girl archly, "doesn't sound very productive to
me."
 
"No? Well have I got news for you, my love. We have discovered
this planet's future."
 
Ford waited for this statement to have its effect. It didn't have
any. They didn't know what he was talking about.
 
He continued.
 
"It doesn't matter a pair of fetid dingo's kidneys what you all
choose to do from now on. Burn down the forests, anything, it
won't make a scrap of difference. Your future history has already
happened. Two million years you've got and that's it. At the end
of that time your race will be dead, gone and good riddance to
you. Remember that, two million years!"
 
The crowd muttered to itself in annoyance. People as rich as they
had suddenly become shouldn't be obliged to listen to this sort
of gibberish. Perhaps they could tip the fellow a leaf or two and
he would go away.
 
They didn't need to bother. Ford was already stalking out of the
clearing, pausing only to shake his head at Number Two who was
already firing his Kill-O-Zap gun into some neighbouring trees.
 
He turned back once.
 
"Two million years!" he said and laughed.
 
"Well," said the Captain with a soothing smile, "still time for a
few more baths. Could someone pass me the sponge? I just dropped
it over the side."
 
=================================================================
Chapter 33
 
A mile or so away through the wood, Arthur Dent was too busily
engrossed with what he was doing to hear Ford Prefect approach.
 
What he was doing was rather curious, and this is what it was: on
a wide flat piece of rock he had scratched out the shape of a
large square, subdivided into one hundred and sixty-nine smaller
squares, thirteen to a side.
 
Furthermore he had collected together a pile of smallish flattish
stones and scratched the shape of a letter on to each. Sitting
morosely round the rock were a couple of the surviving local
native men whom Arthur Dent was trying to introduce the curious
concept embodied in these stones.
 
So far they had not done well. They had attempted to eat some of
them, bury others and throw the rest of them away. Arthur had
finally encouraged one of them to lay a couple of stones on the
board he had scratched out, which was not even as far as he'd
managed to get the day before. Along with the rapid deterioration
in the morale of these creatures, there seemed to be a
corresponding deterioration in their actual intelligence.
 
In an attempt to egg them along, Arthur set out a number of
letters on the board himself, and then tried to encourage the
natives to add some more themselves.
 
It was not going well.
 
Ford watched quietly from beside a nearby tree.
 
"No," said Arthur to one of the natives who had just shuffled
some of the letters round in a fit of abysmal dejection, "Q
scores ten you see, and it's on a triple word score, so ... look,
I've explained the rules to you ... no no, look please, put down
that jawbone ... alright, we'll start again. And try to
concentrate this time."
 
Ford leaned his elbow against the tree and his hand against his
head.
 
"What are you doing, Arthur?" he asked quietly.
 
Arthur looked up with a start. He suddenly had a feeling that all
this might look slightly foolish. All he knew was that it had
worked like a dream on him when he was a chid. But things were
different then, or rather would be.
 
"I'm trying to teach the cavemen to play Scrabble," he said.
 
"They're not cavemen," said Ford.
 
"They look like cavemen."
 
Ford let it pass.
 
"I see," he said.
 
"It's uphill work," said Arthur wearily, "the only word they know
is grunt and they can't spell it."
 
He sighed and sat back.
 
"What's that supposed to achieve?" asked Ford.
 
"We've got to encourage them to evolve! To develop!" Arthur burst
out angrily. He hoped that the weary sigh and then the anger
might do something to counteract the overriding feeling of
foolishness from which he was currently suffering. It didn't. He
jumped to his feet.
 
"Can you imagine what a world would be like descended from those
... cretins we arrived with?" he said.
 
"Imagine?" said Ford, rising his eyebrows. "We don't have to
imagine. We've seen it."
 
"But ..." Arthur waved his arms about hopelessly.
 
"We've seen it," said Ford, "there's no escape."
 
Arthur kicked at a stone.
 
"Did you tell them what we've discovered?" he asked.
 
"Hmmmm?" said Ford, not really concentrating.
 
"Norway," said Arthur, "Slartibartfast's signature in the
glacier. Did you tell them?"
 
"What's the point?" said Ford, "What would it mean to them?"
 
"Mean?" said Arthur, "Mean? You know perfectly well what it
means. It means that this planet is the Earth! It's my home! It's
where I was born!"
 
"Was?" said Ford.
 
"Alright, will be."
 
"Yes, in two million years' time. Why don't you tell them that?
Go and say to them, `Excuse me, I'd just like to point out that
in two million years' time I will be born just a few miles from
here.' See what they say. They'll chase you up a tree and set
fire to it."
 
Arthur absorbed this unhappily.
 
"Face it," said Ford, "those zeebs over there are your ancestors,
not these poor creatures here."
 
He went over to where the apemen creatures were rummaging
listlessly with the stone letters. He shook his head.
 
"Put the Scrabble away, Arthur," he said, "it won't save the
human race, because this lot aren't going to be the human race.
The human race is currently sitting round a rock on the other
side of this hill making documentaries about themselves."
 
Arthur winced.
 
"There must be something we can do," he said. A terrible sense of
desolation thrilled through his body that he should be here, on
the Earth, the Earth which had lost its future in a horrifying
arbitrary catastrophe and which now seemed set to lose its past
as well.
 
"No," said Ford, "there's nothing we can do. This doesn't change
the history of the Earth, you see, this is the history of the
Earth. Like it or leave it, the Golgafrinchans are the people you
are descended from. in two million years they get destroyed by
the Vogons. History is never altered you see, it just fits
together like a jigsaw. Funny old thing, life, isn't it?"
 
He picked up the letter Q and hurled it into a distant pivet bush
where it hit a young rabbit. The rabbit hurtled off in terror and
didn't stop till it was set upon and eaten by a fox which choked
on one of its bones and died on the bank of a stream which
subsequently washed it away.
 
During the following weeks Ford Prefect swallowed his pride and
struck up a relationship with a girl who had been a personnel
officer on Golgafrincham, and he was terribly upset when she
suddenly passed away as a result of drinking water from a pool
that had been polluted by the body of a dead fox. The only moral
it is possible to draw from this story is that one should never
throw the letter Q into a pivet bush, but unfortunately there are
times when it is unavoidable.
 
Like most of the really crucial things in life, this chain of
events was completely invisible to Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent.
They were looking sadly at one of the natives morosely pushing
the other letters around.
 
"Poor bloody caveman," said Arthur.
 
"They're not ..."
 
"What?"
 
"Oh never mind."
 
The wretched creature let out a pathetic howling noise and banged
on the rock.
 
"It's all been a bit of waste of time for them, hasn't it?" said
Arthur.
 
"Uh uh urghhhhh," muttered the native and banged on the rock
again.
 
"They've been outevolved by telephone sanitizers."
 
"Urgh, gr gr, gruh!" insisted the native, continuing to bang on
the rock.
 
"Why does he keep banging on the rock?" said Arthur.
 
"I think he probably wants you to Scrabble with him again," said
Ford, "he's pointing at the letters."
 
"Probably spelt crzjgrdwldiwdc again, poor bastard. I keep on
telling him there's only one g in crzjgrdwldiwdc."
 
The native banged on the rock again.
 
They looked over his shoulder.
 
Their eyes popped.
 
There amongst the jumble of letters were eight that had been laid
out in a clear straight line.
 
They spelt two words.
 
The words were these:
 
"Forty-Two."
 
"Grrrurgh guh guh," explained the native. He swept the letters
angrily away and went and mooched under a nearby tree with his
colleague.
 
Ford and Arthur stared at him. Then they stared at each other.
 
"Did that say what I thought it said?" they both said to each
other.
 
"Yes," they both said.
 
"Forty-two," said Arthur.
 
"Forty-two," said Ford.
 
Arthur ran over to the two natives.
 
"What are you trying to tell us?" he shouted. "What's it supposed
to mean?"
 
One of them rolled over on the ground, kicked his legs up in the
air, rolled over again and went to sleep.
 
The other bounded up the tree and threw horse chestnuts at Ford
Prefect. Whatever it was they had to say, they had already said
it.
 
"You know what this means," said Ford.
 
"Not entirely."
 
"Forty-two is the number Deep Thought gave as being the Ultimate
Answer."
 
"Yes."
 
And the Earth is the computer Deep Thought designed and built to
calculate the Question to the Ultimate Answer."
 
"So we are led to believe."
 
"And organic life was part of the computer matrix."
 
"If you say so."
 
"I do say so. That means that these natives, these apemen are an
integral part of the computer program, and that we and the
Golgafrinchans are not."
 
"But the cavemen are dying out and the Golgafrinchans are
obviously set to replace them."
 
"Exactly. So do you see what this means?"
 
"What?"
 
"Cock up," said Ford Prefect.
 
Arthur looked around him.
 
"This planet is having a pretty bloody time of it," he said.
 
Ford puzzled for a moment.
 
"Still, something must have come out of it," he said at last,
"because Marvin said he could see the Question printed in your
brain wave patterns."
 
"But ..."
 
"Probably the wrong one, or a distortion of the right one. It
might give us a clue though if we could find it. I don't see how
we can though."
 
They moped about for a bit. Arthur sat on the ground and started
pulling up bits of grass, but found that it wasn't an occupation
he could get deeply engrossed in. It wasn't grass he could
believe in, the trees seemed pointless, the rolling hills seemed
to be rolling to nowhere and the future seemed just a tunnel to
be crawled through.
 
Ford fiddled with his Sub-Etha Sens-O-Matic. It was silent. He
sighed and put it away.
 
Arthur picked up one of the letter stones from his home-made
Scrabble set. It was a T. He sighed and out it down again. The
letter he put down next to it was an I. That spelt IT. He tossed
another couple of letters next to them They were an S and an H as
it happened. By a curious coincidence the resulting word
perfectly expressed the way Arthur was feeling about things just
then. He stared at it for a moment. He hadn't done it
deliberately, it was just a random chance. His brain got slowly
into first gear.
 
"Ford," he said suddenly, "look, if that Question is printed in
my brain wave patterns but I'm not consciously aware of it it
must be somewhere in my unconscious."
 
"Yes, I suppose so."
 
"There might be a way of bringing that unconscious pattern
forward."
 
"Oh yes?"
 
"Yes, by introducing some random element that can be shaped by
that pattern."
 
"Like how?"
 
"Like by pulling Scrabble letters out of a bag blindfolded."
 
Ford leapt to his feet.
 
"Brilliant!" he said. He tugged his towel out of his satchel and
with a few deft knots transformed it into a bag.
 
"Totally mad," he said, "utter nonsense. But we'll do it because
it's brilliant nonsense. Come on, come on."
 
The sun passed respectfully behind a cloud. A few small sad
raindrops fell.
 
They piled together all the remaining letters and dropped them
into the bag. They shook them up.
 
"Right," said Ford, "close your eyes. Pull them out. Come on come
on, come on."
 
Arthur closed his eyes and plunged his hand into the towelful of
stones. He jiggled them about, pulled out four and handed them to
Ford. Ford laid them along the ground in the order he got them.
 
"W," said Ford, "H, A, T ... What!"
 
He blinked.
 
"I think it's working!" he said.
 
Arthur pushed three more at him.
 
"D, O, Y ... Doy. Oh perhaps it isn't working," said Ford.
 
"Here's the next three."
 
"O, U, G ... Doyoug ... It's not making sense I'm afraid."
 
Arthur pulled another two from the bag. Ford put them in place.
 
"E, T, doyouget ... Do you get!" shouted Ford, "it is working!
This is amazing, it really is working!"
 
"More here." Arthur was throwing them out feverishly as fast as
he could go.
 
"I, F," said Ford, "Y, O, U, ... M, U, L, T, I, P, L, Y, ... What
do you get if you multiply, ... S, I, X, ... six, B, Y, by, six
by ... what do you get if you multiply six by ... N, I, N, E, ...
six by nine ..." He paused. "Come on, where's the next one?"
 
"Er, that's the lot," said Arthur, "that's all there were."
 
He sat back, nonplussed.
 
He rooted around again in the knotted up towel but there were no
more letters.
 
"You mean that's it?" said Ford.
 
"That's it."
 
"Six by nine. Forty-two."
 
"That's it. That's all there is."

Chapter 34
 
The sun came out and beamed cheerfully at them. A bird sang. A
warm breeze wafted through the trees and lifted the heads of the
flowers, carrying their scent away through the woods. An insect
droned past on its way to do whatever it is that insects do in
the late afternoon. The sound of voices lilted through the trees
followed a moment later by two girls who stopped in surprise at
the sight of Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent apparently lying on the
ground in agony, but in fact rocking with noiseless laughter.
 
"No, don't go," called Ford Prefect between gasps, "we'll be with
you in a moment."
 
"What's the matter?" asked one of the girls. She was the taller
and slimmer of the two. On Golgafrincham she had been a junior
personnel officer, but hadn't liked it much.
 
Ford pulled himself together.
 
"Excuse me," he said, "hello. My friend and I were just
contemplating the meaning of life. Frivolous exercise."
 
"Oh it's you," said the girl, "you made a bit of a spectacle of
yourself this afternoon. You were quite funny to begin with but
you did bang on a bit."
 
"Did I? Oh yes."
 
"Yes, what was all that for?" asked the other girl, a shorter
round-faced girl who had been an art director for a small
advertising company on Golgafrincham. Whatever the privations of
this world were, she went to sleep every night profoundly
grateful for the fact that whatever she had to face in the
morning it wouldn't be a hundred almost identical photographs of
moodily lit tubes of toothpaste.
 
"For? For nothing. Nothing's for anything," said Ford Prefect
happily. "Come and join us. I"m Ford, this is Arthur. We were
just about to do nothing at all for a while but it can wait."
 
The girls looked at them doubtfully.
 
"I'm Agda," said the tall one, "this is Mella."
 
"Hello Agda, hello Mella," said Ford.
 
"Do you talk at all?" said Mella to Arthur.
 
"Oh, eventually," said Arthur with a smile, "but not as much as
Ford."
 
"Good."
 
There was a slight pause.
 
"What did you mean," asked Agda, "about only having two million
years? I couldn't make sense of what you were saying."
 
"Oh that," said Ford, "it doesn't matter."
 
"It's just that the world gets demolished to make way for a
hyperspace bypass," said Arthur with a shrug, "but that's two
million years away, and anyway it's just Vogons doing what Vogons
do."
 
"Vogons?" said Mella.
 
"Yes, you wouldn't know them."
 
"Where'd you get this idea from?"
 
"It really doesn't matter. It's just like a dream from the past,
or the future." Arthur smiled and looked away.
 
"Does it worry you that you don't talk any kind of sense?" asked
Agda.
 
"Listen, forget it," said Ford, "forget all of it. Nothing
matters. Look, it's a beautiful day, enjoy it. The sun, the green
of the hills, the river down in the valley, the burning trees."
 
"Even if it's only a dream, it's a pretty horrible idea," said
Mella, "destroying a world just to make a bypass."
 
"Oh, I've heard of worse," said Ford, "I read of one planet off
in the seventh dimension that got used as a ball in a game of
intergalactic bar billiards. Got potted straight into a black
hole. Killed ten billion people."
 
"That's mad," said Mella.
 
"Yes, only scored thirty points too."
 
Agda and Mella exchanged glances.
 
"Look," said Agda, "there's a party after the committee meeting
tonight. You can come along if you like."
 
"Yeah, OK," said Ford.
 
"I'd like to," said Arthur.
 
Many hours later Arthur and Mella sat and watched the moon rise
over the dull red glow of the trees.
 
"That story about the world being destroyed ..." began Mella.
 
"In two million years, yes."
 
"You say it as if you really think it's true."
 
"Yes, I think it is. I think I was there."
 
She shook her head in puzzlement.
 
"You're very strange," she said.
 
"No, I'm very ordinary," said Arthur, "but some very strange
things have happened to me. You could say I'm more differed from
than differing."
 
"And that other world your friend talked about, the one that got
pushed into a black hole."
 
"Ah, that I don't know about. It sounds like something from the
book."
 
"What book?"
 
Arthur paused.
 
"The Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy," he said at last.
 
"What's that?"
 
"Oh, just something I threw into the river this evening. I don't
think I'll be wanting it any more," said Arthur Dent.
